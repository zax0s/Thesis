\chapter{Implementation of dynamic functions in CASToR and dynamic simulator}

\begin{itemize}
    \item  How dynamic reconstruction was implemented in CASToR (in relation to the methods explained in the theory section). \\
    \item  How dynamic models were implemented in simulation. Short demonstration of simulation and reconstruction using a custom phantom from real mMR data.  \\
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Simulation Study}
The gap paper and expand if time permits. Describe more on spectral model and $K1$ and micro-parameters comparison also. \\

\chapter{Advancements in WB and WB-Dynamic reconstruction}
\label{chap:Results_CASToR}
