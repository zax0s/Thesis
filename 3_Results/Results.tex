\chapter{Developments and Advancements in Dynamic Whole Body Reconstruction}
\input{3_Results/3_2_DWB_Reconstruction/3_2_DWB_Reconstruction}
%How dynamic reconstruction was implemented in CASToR (in relation to the methods explained in the theory section). 
%Short demonstration of simulation and reconstruction using 2D example.  \\
%All the works with real data , single and multi bed.  \\ 
%The use of the Spectral model and offered advantages in pharmacokinetic studies. \\
%Residuals work. \\

\chapter{Simulation Study}
The gap paper and expand if time permits. Describe more on spectral model and $K1$ and micro-parameters comparison also. \\
