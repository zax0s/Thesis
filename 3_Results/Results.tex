\section{Implementation of dynamic functions in CASToR }
How dynamic reconstruction was implemented in CASToR (in relation to the methods explained in the theory section). \\

\section{Simulation Study}
The gap paper and expand. Describe more on spectral model and do $K1$ and spectrum comparisons also. \\

\section{Advancements in WB and WB-Dynamic reconstruction}
All the déjà unique implementations in CASTOR. \\
Theory and practice for Dynamic Whole Body reconstruction (direct and nested), with toy simulation example and macaque data. \\

\section{Real exam data: IsotoPK, Lung NSCLC etc.}
All the works with real data , single and multi bed.  \\ 
The use of the Spectral model advantages in pharmacokinetic studies. \\

\section{Other projects: HYBRID, CASToR etc.}
All the other projects within Hybrid ! \\
