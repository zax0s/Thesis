abstract = {PURPOSE In this article, we discuss dynamic whole-body (DWB) positron emission tomography (PET) as an imaging tool with significant clinical potential, in relation to conventional standard uptake value (SUV) imaging. BACKGROUND DWB PET involves dynamic data acquisition over an extended axial range, capturing tracer kinetic information that is not available with conventional static acquisition protocols. The method can be performed within reasonable clinical imaging times, and enables generation of multiple types of PET images with complementary information in a single imaging session. Importantly, DWB PET can be used to produce multi-parametric images of (i) Patlak slope (influx rate) and (ii) intercept (referred to sometimes as "distribution volume"), while also providing (iii) a conventional 'SUV-equivalent' image for certain protocols. RESULTS We provide an overview of ongoing efforts (primarily focused on FDG PET) and discuss potential clinically relevant applications. CONCLUSION Overall, the framework of DWB imaging [applicable to both PET/CT(computed tomography) and PET/MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)] generates quantitative measures that may add significant value to conventional SUV image-derived measures, with limited pitfalls as we also discuss in this work.},

abstract = {Static whole-body PET/CT, employing the standardized uptake value (SUV), is considered the standard clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment response monitoring for a wide range of oncologic malignancies. Alternative PET protocols involving dynamic acquisition of temporal images have been implemented in the research setting, allowing quantification of tracer dynamics, an important capability for tumor characterization and treatment response monitoring. Nonetheless, dynamic protocols have been confined to single-bed-coverage limiting the axial field-of-view to ∼15–20 cm, and have not been translated to the routine clinical context of whole-body PET imaging for the inspection of disseminated disease. Here, we pursue a transition to dynamic whole-body PET parametric imaging, by presenting, within a unified framework, clinically feasible multi-bed dynamic PET acquisition protocols and parametric imaging methods. We investigate solutions to address the challenges of: (i) long acquisitions, (ii) small number of dynamic frames per bed, and (iii) non-invasive quantification of kinetics in the plasma. In the present study, a novel dynamic (4D) whole-body PET acquisition protocol of ∼45 min total length is presented, composed of (i) an initial 6 min dynamic PET scan (24 frames) over the heart, followed by (ii) a sequence of multi-pass multi-bed PET scans (six passes × seven bed positions, each scanned for 45 s). Standard Patlak linear graphical analysis modeling was employed, coupled with image-derived plasma input function measurements. Ordinary least squares Patlak estimation was used as the baseline regression method to quantify the physiological parameters of tracer uptake rate K i and total blood distribution volume V on an individual voxel basis. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies, using a wide set of published kinetic FDG parameters and GATE and XCAT platforms, were conducted to optimize the acquisition protocol from a range of ten different clinically acceptable sampling schedules examined. The framework was also applied to six FDG PET patient studies, demonstrating clinical feasibility. Both simulated and clinical results indicated enhanced contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) for K i images in tumor regions with notable background FDG concentration, such as the liver, where SUV performed relatively poorly. Overall, the proposed framework enables enhanced quantification of physiological parameters across the whole body. In addition, the total acquisition length can be reduced from 45 to ∼35 min and still achieve improved or equivalent CNR compared to SUV, provided the true K i contrast is sufficiently high. In the follow-up companion paper, a set of advanced linear regression schemes is presented to particularly address the presence of noise, and attempt to achieve a better trade-off between the mean-squared error and the CNR metrics, resulting in enhanced task-based imaging.

abstract = {PET was developed in the 1970s as an in vivo method to measure regional pathophysiologic processes. In the 1990s the focus moved to the detection of local increases in uptake, first in the brain (activation studies) and later in oncology (finding metastases), with 18F-FDG emerging as a highly sensitive staging technique. This focus on sensitivity has overshadowed the other main characteristic of PET, its quantitative nature. In recent years there has been a shift. PET is now seen as a promising tool for drug development and precision medicine-that is, a method to monitor or even predict response to therapy. Quantification is essential for precision medicine, but many studies today use simplified semiquantitative methods without properly validating them. This review provides several examples illustrating that simplified methods may lead to less accurate or even misleading results. Simplification is important for routine clinical practice, but finding the optimal balance between accuracy and simplicity requires careful studies. It is argued that the use of simplified approaches without proper validation not only may waste time and resources but also may raise ethical questions, especially in drug development studies.},

@article{Cherry2017,
abstract = {PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4-5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world's first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article , we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET. Al l nuclear medicine studies in humans are limited by the trade-offs between the number of detected decay events, imaging time, and absorbed dose. The number of detected events determines the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the final image, but constraints on administered activity, as well as high random event rates and dead time that occur at high activities, currently prevent acquisition of high-SNR images in short times. This in turn limits the ability to perform high-resolution, dynamic imaging studies with tracer kinetic modeling, because short-time-frame datasets are always noisy. A further limitation is that although the tracer injection is systemic and radiotracer is present in the entire body, current imaging systems contain only a small portion of the body within the field of view (FOV). For applications in which the distribution of radiotracer in the entire body or multiple organ systems is of interest, this limitation leads to further inefficiencies and makes it difficult to acquire dynamic data from all the tissues of interest. If one takes whole-body PET scanning with 18 F-FDG as an example, the total efficiency with which pairs of coincidence photons that escape the body are detected is well under 1{\%} even on today's best scanners. Simplistically, this number can be derived by considering that the average geometric sensitivity within the FOV of a typical clinical PET scanner is under 5{\%} and that with an axial coverage of 20 cm, less than an eighth of the body is in the FOV at any one time. In this article, we discuss how improving the geometric coverage directly increases sensitivity by over an order of magnitude for total-body PET scans. We describe progress to date on building the first prototype total-body scanner that will show a roughly 40-fold sensitivity gain over existing PET scanners for imaging the entire body. We also discuss how such a large increase in effective sensitivity has the potential to dramatically broaden the utility of PET in human medical research, potentially leading to new clinical applications, as well as how it can positively affect existing clinical applications. Finally, we describe how anticipated improvements in timing resolution can produce further increases in effective sensitivity, leading to the prospect of PET scanners that are about 200 times more sensitive than current commercial systems for total-body imaging. FROM WHOLE-BODY PET TO TOTAL-BODY PET There are two major factors contributing to the extremely poor sensitivity (,1{\%}) for current whole-body PET scans (Fig. 1A). The first and most obvious is that at any one time, roughly 85{\%}-90{\%} of the body is outside the FOV of the scanner and no signal from these regions of the body is collected. Second, even for the tissues and organs within the scanner FOV, no more than about 3{\%}-5{\%} of the available signal (photon pairs that escape the body without being attenuated or scattered) can be collected, because the radiation is emitted isotopically and most does not intercept the detector rings. Both factors are addressed by extending the detector rings so that they cover the entire body (Fig. 1B). This concept, which we call total-body PET, allows almost maximal detection of the radiation emitted from the body. Computer simulations of a cylindric phantom approximating the dimensions of the adult human predict that extending a PET scanner from a typical 20-cm axial FOV to a 200-cm FOV leads to an approximately 40-fold increase in the effective sensitivity (as measured by the noise-equivalent counting rate) for imaging the body from},

abstract = {An overview of the theory of 4D image reconstruction for emission tomography is given along with a review of the current state of the art, covering both positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). By viewing 4D image reconstruction as a matter of either linear or non-linear parameter estimation for a set of spatiotemporal functions chosen to approximately represent the radiotracer distribution, the areas of so-called 'fully 4D' image reconstruction and 'direct kinetic parameter estimation' are unified within a common framework. Many choices of linear and non-linear parameterization of these functions are considered (including the important case where the parameters have direct biological meaning), along with a review of the algorithms which are able to estimate these often non-linear parameters from emission tomography data. The other crucial components to image reconstruction (the objective function, the system model and the raw data format) are also covered, but in less detail due to the relatively straightforward extension from their corresponding components in conventional 3D image reconstruction. The key unifying concept is that maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of either linear or non-linear model parameters can be achieved in image space after carrying out a conventional expectation maximization (EM) update of the dynamic image series, using a Kullback-Leibler distance metric (comparing the modeled image values with the EM image values), to optimize the desired parameters. For MAP, an image-space penalty for regularization purposes is required. The benefits of 4D and direct reconstruction reported in the literature are reviewed, and furthermore demonstrated with simple simulation examples. It is clear that the future of reconstructing dynamic or functional emission tomography images, which often exhibit high levels of spatially correlated noise, should ideally exploit these 4D approaches.},

abstract = {Kinetic parameter estimation in dynamic PET suffers from reduced accuracy and precision when parametric maps are estimated using kinetic modelling following image reconstruction of the dynamic data. Direct approaches to parameter estimation attempt to directly estimate the kinetic parameters from the measured dynamic data within a unified framework. Such image reconstruction methods have been shown to generate parametric maps of improved precision and accuracy in dynamic PET. However, due to the interleaving between the tomographic and kinetic modelling steps, any tomographic or kinetic modelling errors in certain regions or frames, tend to spatially or temporally propagate. This results in biased kinetic parameters and thus limits the benefits of such direct methods. Kinetic modelling errors originate from the inability to construct a common single kinetic model for the entire field-of-view, and such errors in erroneously modelled regions could spatially propagate. Adaptive models have been used within 4D image reconstruction to mitigate the problem, though they are complex and difficult to optimize. Tomographic errors in dynamic imaging on the other hand, can originate from involuntary patient motion between dynamic frames, as well as from emission/transmission mismatch. Motion correction schemes can be used, however, if residual errors exist or motion correction is not included in the study protocol, errors in the affected dynamic frames could potentially propagate either temporally, to other frames during the kinetic modelling step or spatially, during the tomographic step. In this work, we demonstrate a new strategy to minimize such error propagation in direct 4D image reconstruction, focusing on the tomographic step rather than the kinetic modelling step, by incorporating time-of-flight (TOF) within a direct 4D reconstruction framework. Using ever improving TOF resolutions (580 ps, 440 ps, 300 ps and 160 ps), we demonstrate that direct 4D TOF image reconstruction can substantially prevent kinetic parameter error propagation either from erroneous kinetic modelling, inter-frame motion or emission/transmission mismatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the benefits of TOF in parameter estimation when conventional post-reconstruction (3D) methods are used and compare the potential improvements to direct 4D methods. Further improvements could possibly be achieved in the future by combining TOF direct 4D image reconstruction with adaptive kinetic models and inter-frame motion correction schemes.},

abstract = {Methods for adaptively fitting kinetic models to image data are explored. In conducting this fitting two goals are set: 1) that good fits are obtained for all image voxels; and 2) that where a primary biologically based model is appropriate, this model is used. The first goal is obtained through the inclusion of a more general secondary model. The second goal is achieved through the penalisation of estimates from this secondary model with the weighting of this penalisation optimised using generalised cross validation. The result is a modelling scheme where the secondary model is adaptively included for voxels that the primary model is unable to fit. The envisaged application is in 4D (space and time) reconstruction to prevent spatial propagation of errors from regions where a primary model is not appropriate. An evaluation of reconstructed clinical data using a dataset with challenging kinetics has been conducted. Application to the clinical dataset showed promising results with the modelling scheme able to fit kinetics associated with activity in the region of the injection site veins, the right ventricle, right atrium and the gall bladder. The method requires the careful selection of the secondary model and further work is needed to optimise this selection and evaluate the benefit for 4D reconstruction. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {We describe a new technique for the analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies in humans, where data consist of the time courses of label in tissue regions of interest and in arterial blood, following the administration of radiolabelled tracers. The technique produces a simple spectrum of the kinetic components which relate the tissue's response to the blood activity curve. From this summary of the kinetic components, the tissue's unit impulse response can be derived. The convolution of the arterial input function with the derived unit impulse response function gives the curve of best fit to the observed tissue data. The analysis makes no a priori assumptions regarding the number of compartments or components required to describe the time course of label in the tissue. Rather, it is based on a general linear model, presented here in a formulation compatible with its solution using standard computer algorithms. Its application is illustrated with reference to cerebral blood flow, glucose utilization, and ligand binding. The interpretation of the spectra, and of the tissue unit impulse response functions, are discussed in terms of vascular components, unidirectional clearance of tracer by the tissue, and reversible and irreversible phenomena. The significance of the number of components which can be identified within a given datum set is also discussed. The technique facilitates the interpretation of dynamic PET data and simplifies comparisons between regions and between subjects.},

abstract = {Direct 4D image reconstruction algorithms can improve kinetic parameter precision and accuracy in dynamic PET/CT body imaging but in contrast to post-reconstruction kinetic analysis, errors in badly modeled regions will spatially propagate to regions which are well modeled. To reduce error propagation from erroneous model fits, we propose a new approach to direct 4D image reconstruction by incorporating a newly proposed kinetic modeling strategy. This uses a secondary model to allow a less constrained model fit in regions where an erroneous kinetic model is used and adaptively include a portion of the residuals back into the image, whilst preserving the primary model characteristics in other well modeled regions. Using a digital 4-D phantom to simulate [15O]-H2O kinetics, we demonstrate substantial bias reduction due to propagation in all kinetic parameters using the proposed 4-D method. Under noisy conditions improvements in bias due to propagation are obtained at the expense of a small increase in bias due to noise and selective inclusion of residuals coming from erroneous kinetic modeling, as opposed to noise, becomes more challenging. However, the overall bias is reduced with improvements depending on the proximity of regions of interest to badly modeled regions and the choice of the secondary model space. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Merlin2018,
abstract = {In tomographic medical imaging (PET, SPECT, CT), differences in data acquisition and organization are a major hurdle for the development of tomographic reconstruction software. The implementation of a given reconstruction algorithm is usually limited to a specific set of conditions, depending on the modality, the purpose of the study, the input data, or on the characteristics of the reconstruction algorithm itself. It causes restricted or limited use of algorithms, differences in implementation, code duplication, impractical code development, and difficulties for comparing different methods. This work attempts to address these issues by proposing a unified and generic code framework for formatting, processing and reconstructing acquired multi-modal and multi-dimensional data. The proposed iterative framework processes in the same way elements from list-mode (i.e. events) and histogrammed (i.e. sinogram or other bins) data sets. Each element is processed separately, which opens the way for highly parallel execution. A unique iterative algorithm engine makes use of generic core components corresponding to the main parts of the reconstruction process. Features that are specific to different modalities and algorithms are embedded into specific components inheriting from the generic abstract components. Temporal dimensions are taken into account in the core architecture. The framework is implemented in an open-source C++ parallel platform, called CASToR (customizable and advanced software for tomographic reconstruction). Performance assessments show that the time loss due to genericity remains acceptable, being one order of magnitude slower compared to a manufacturer's software optimized for computational efficiency for a given system geometry. Specific optimizations were made possible by the underlying data set organization and processing and allowed for an average speed-up factor ranging from 1.54 to 3.07 when compared to more conventional implementations. Using parallel programming, an almost linear speed-up increase (factor of 0.85 times number of cores) was obtained in a realistic clinical PET setting. In conclusion, the proposed framework offers a substantial flexibility for the integration of new reconstruction algorithms while maintaining computation efficiency.},
