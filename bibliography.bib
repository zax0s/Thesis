abstract = {The generalized linear least squares (GLLS) algorithm has been found useful in image-wide parameter estimation for the generation of parametric images with positron emission tomography (PET) as it is computationally efficient and statistically reliable. However, the original algorithm was designed for parameter estimation with non-uniformly sampled instantaneous measurements. When dynamic PET data are sampled with the optimal image sampling schedule (OISS) to reduce memory and storage space, only a few temporal image frames are recorded. As a result, the direct application of GLLS is no longer appropriate. In this paper, we extend the GLLS algorithm to a five parameter model for the study of human brain metabolism, which accounts for the effect of cerebral blood volume (CBV), using OISS sampled data, with as few as five temporal samples. The formulation for this new GLLS algorithm is developed, and its computational efficiency and statistical reliability are investigated and validated using computer simulations and clinical PET [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) data. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {A kinetic modelling method for the determination of influx constant, Ki is given that utilises basis functions derived from plasma input two-tissue compartmental models (BAFPIC). Two forms of the basis functions are given: BAFPICI with k4=0 (no product loss) and BAFPICR with k4 non-zero. Simulations were performed using literature rate constant values for [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in both normal and abnormal brain pathology. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous tissues were simulated and this data was also used as input for other methods commonly used to determine Ki: non-linear least squares compartmental modelling (NLLS), autoradiographic method and Patlak-Gjedde graphical analysis (PGA). The four methods were also compared for real FDG positron emission tomography (PET) data. For both k4=0 and k4 non-zero simulated data BAFPIC had the best bias properties of the four methods. The autoradiographic method was always the best for variability but BAFPICI had lower variability than PGA and NLLS. For non-zero k4 data, the variance of BAFPICR was inferior to PGA but still significantly superior to NLLS. Ki maps calculated from real data substantiate the simulation results, with BAFPICI having lower noise than PGA. Voxel Ki values from BAFPICI correlated well with those from PGA (r2=0.989). BAFPIC is easy to implement and combines low bias with good noise properties for voxel-wise determination of Ki for FDG. BAFPIC is suitable for determining Ki for other tracers well characterised by a serial two-tissue compartment model and has the advantage of also producing values for individual kinetic constants and blood volume. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Cunningham1993,
abstract = {We describe a new technique for the analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies in humans, where data consist of the time courses of label in tissue regions of interest and in arterial blood, following the administration of radiolabelled tracers. The technique produces a simple spectrum of the kinetic components which relate the tissue's response to the blood activity curve. From this summary of the kinetic components, the tissue's unit impulse response can be derived. The convolution of the arterial input function with the derived unit impulse response function gives the curve of best fit to the observed tissue data. The analysis makes no a priori assumptions regarding the number of compartments or components required to describe the time course of label in the tissue. Rather, it is based on a general linear model, presented here in a formulation compatible with its solution using standard computer algorithms. Its application is illustrated with reference to cerebral blood flow, glucose utilization, and ligand binding. The interpretation of the spectra, and of the tissue unit impulse response functions, are discussed in terms of vascular components, unidirectional clearance of tracer by the tissue, and reversible and irreversible phenomena. The significance of the number of components which can be identified within a given datum set is also discussed. The technique facilitates the interpretation of dynamic PET data and simplifies comparisons between regions and between subjects.},

abstract = {With the increased interest in new PET tracers, gene-targeted therapy, immunoPET, and theranostics, other radioisotopes will be increasingly used in clinical PET scanners, in addition to 18F. Some of the most interesting radioisotopes with prospective use in the new fields are not pure short-range $\beta$+ emitters but can be associated with gamma emissions in coincidence with the annihilation radiation (prompt gamma), gamma-gamma cascades, intense Bremsstrahlung radiation, high-energy positrons that may escape out of the patient skin, and high-energy gamma rays that result in some e+/e− pair production. The high level of sophistication in data correction and excellent quantitative accuracy that has been reached for 18F in recent years can be questioned by these effects. In this work, we review the physics and the scientific literature and evaluate the effect of these additional phenomena on the PET data for each of a series of radioisotopes: 11C, 13N, 15O, 18F, 64Cu, 68Ga, 76Br, 82Rb, 86Y, 89Zr, 90Y, and 124I. In particular, we discuss the present complications arising from the prompt gammas, and we review the scientific literature on prompt gamma correction. For some of the radioisotopes considered in this work, prompt gamma correction is definitely needed to assure acceptable image quality, and several approaches have been proposed in recent years. Bremsstrahlung photons and 176Lu background were also evaluated.},

The objective of this paper is to provide the reader with the terminology and understanding of how PET data are acquired and orga-nized as well as the issues involved in choosing one ap-proach over another. Sinograms and projection views will be presented as methods of storing and viewing raw PET data. Different approaches to increase axial sampling while main-taining a sufficient number of counts for each reconstructed slice are discussed, as well as the use of sinogram com-pression or " mashing " to reduce the storage requirements of raw PET data. The differences between 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) PET and how storage of raw 3D data may differ from that of 2D data are described. The concept of " Michelograms " as a means of displaying the nature of the axial sampling in both 2D and 3D PET is discussed. After reading this paper, the reader will be able to describe 2 methods used to store and display raw PET data and com-pare them with methods used in SPECT. The reader will be able to define the terms " span " and " maximum ring differ-ence " and describe how they relate to the axial sampling in 2D and 3D PET. The reader will also be able to list 3 ways in which 3D PET differs from 2D PET.},

The advancements that have benchmarked PET progress are the result of key components that include human intellect and passion for PET technology, relentless persuasion of key political forces to eliminate the barriers precluding PET usage, tireless efforts to raise awareness about PET and a crucial network of support throughout the PET community. This article sets forth a timeline of significant events that have contributed to the development of PET as it is known today. It introduces the earliest physicist and physician, for instance, who were responsible for the first medical applications for positron emitting radioisotopes using a simple brain probe that utilized coincidence to localize brain tumors. Additionally, it identifies landmark technological achievements that have helped pave the way to modern PET. This study includes historical accounts surrounding the use of the first human PET tomograph, discovery of the Bismuth Germanate (BGO) scintillator, development of the Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET method, the design of the first PET medical cyclotron with automated chemistry and operated by a PC and a technologist, Food and Drug Administration's approval of FDG, HCFA reimbursement, and the capacity of Lutetium Oxyorthosilicate (LSO) to produce a revolutionary advance in PET scanners. The main thrust of this article is to recognize via a timeline of PET accomplishments the noteworthy work of scientists, physicians and others who have been key players in various aspects of the continuous activity to move PET technology forward from invention to research, and to become a major clinical imaging modality.},

abstract = {Methods for whole-body PET imaging have been developed to provide a clinical tool for the detection and evaluation of primary and metastatic cancers. The axial FOV of the PET system is extended by imaging at multiple bed positions to cover the whole body. In typical rectilinear PET scans, only a small fraction of the data is collected to form two-dimensional projection images. In this work, 100% of the projection data was collected to form the two-dimensional projection images. These projection images were generated for continuous angles over 180° by resorting sinogram data. In addition, tomographic images were formed by using filtered backprojection reconstruction without attenuation correction. Coronal and sagittal cuts were then extracted from the three-dimensional data set. The tomographic images were reconstructed to a resolution of 10.8 mm in all dimensions because of statistical limitations of the data. Both methods of image formation resulted in images of high quality with the tomographic reconstruction providing the highest contrast and resolution. An acquisition time of 1-2 min/bed position after a 10-mCi injection of [18F]fluoride ion or [18F]FDG was found to give a sufficient number of counts for producing images of good resolution and contrast, from a total scanning time of 32-64 min.},

The goal of this work is to determine if we can perform attenuation correction of the PET emission data using accurately aligned CT attenuation information. We discuss possible methods of calculating the PET attenuation map at 511 keV based on CT transmission information acquired from 40 keV through 140 keV. Data were acquired on separate CT and PET scanners and were aligned using standard image registration procedures. Results are presented on three of the attenuation calculation methods: segmentation, scaling, and our proposed hybrid segmentation/scaling method. The results are compared with those using the standard 3D PET attenuation correction method as a gold standard. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed hybrid method for converting the CT attenuation map from an effective CT photon energy of 70 keV to the PET photon energy of 511 keV. We conclude that using CT information is a feasible way to obtain attenuation correction factors for 3D PET.},

abstract = {Hybrid PET/MR systems have rapidly progressed from the prototype stage to systems that are increasingly being used in the clinics. This review provides an overview of developments in hybrid PET/MR systems and summarizes the current state of the art in PET/MR instrumentation, correction techniques, and data analysis. The strong magnetic field requires considerable changes in the manner by which PET images are acquired and has led, among others, to the development of new PET detectors, such as silicon photomultipliers. During more than a decade of active PET/MR development, several system designs have been described. The technical background of combined PET/MR systems is explained and related challenges are discussed. The necessity for PET attenuation correction required new methods based on MR data. Therefore, an overview of recent developments in this field is provided. Furthermore, MR-based motion correction techniques for PET are discussed, as integrated PET/MR systems provide a platform for measuring motion with high temporal resolution without additional instrumentation. The MR component in PET/MR systems can provide functional information about disease processes or brain function alongside anatomic images. Against this background, we point out new opportunities for data analysis in this new field of multimodal molecular imaging.

abstract = {Objectives Technical performance evaluation of a human brain PET/MRI system. Methods The magnetic field compatible positron emission tomography (PET) insert is based on avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays coupled with lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) crystals and slip-fits into a slightly modified clinical 3-T MRI system. The mutual interference between the two imaging techniques was minimised by the careful design of the hardware to maintain the quality of the B0 and B1 field homogeneity. Results The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the homogeneity of the MR images were minimally influenced by the presence of the PET. Measurements according to the Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) protocol proved the combined system's ability to perform functional MRI (fMRI). The performance of the PET insert was evaluated according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standard. The noise equivalent count rate (NEC) peaked at 30.7×103 counts/s at 7.3 kBq/mL. The point source sensitivity was greater than 7 %. The spatial resolution in the centre field of view was less than 3 mm. Patient data sets clearly revealed a noticeably good PET and MR image quality. Conclusion PET and MRI phantom tests and first patient data exhibit the device's potential for simultaneous multiparametric imaging. Key Points ̇ Combination of PET and MRI is a new emerging imaging technology. ̇ Evaluated brain PET/MRI enables uncompromised imaging performance. ̇ PET/MRI aims to provide multiparametric imaging allowing acquisition of morphology and metabolism. {\textcopyright} European Society of Radiology 2012.},

abstract = {The recently released Biograph mMR is the first commercially available integrated whole-body PET/MR scanner. There are considerable advantages to integrating both modalities in a single scanner that enables truly simultaneous acquisition. However, there are also concerns about the possible degradation of both PET and MR performance in an integrated system. This paper evaluates the performance of the Biograph mMR during independent and simultaneous acquisition of PET and morphologic MR data. Methods: The NEMA NU 2-2007 protocol was followed for studying the PET performance. The following measurements were performed: spatial resolution; scatter fraction, count losses, and randoms; sensitivity; accuracy of the correction for count losses and randoms; and image quality. The quality control manual of the American College of Radiology was followed for studying the MR performance. The following measurements were performed: geometric accuracy, spatial resolution, low-contrast detectability, signal-to-noise ratio, static field (B 0) homogeneity, radiofrequency field (B 1) homogeneity, and radiofrequency noise. Results: An average spatial resolution of 4.3 mm in full width at half maximum was measured at 1 cm offset from the center of the field of view. The system sensitivity was 15.0 kcps/MBq along the center of the scanner. The scatter fraction was 37.9%, and the peak noise-equivalent count rate was 184 kcps at 23.1 kBq/mL. The maximum absolute value of the relative count rate error due to dead-time losses and randoms was 5.5%. The average residual error in scatter and attenuation correction was 12.1%. All MR parameters were within the tolerances defined by the American College of Radiology. B 0 inhomogeneities below 1 ppm were measured in a 120-mm radius. B 1 homogeneity and signal-to-noise ratio were equivalent to those of a standard MR scanner. No radiofrequency interference was detected. Conclusion: These results compare favorably with other state-of-the-art PET/CT and PET/MR scanners, indicating that the integration of the PET detectors in the MR scanner and their operation within the magnetic field do not have a perceptible impact on the overall performance. The MR subsystem performs essentially like a standalone system. However, further work is necessary to evaluate the more advanced MR applications, such as functional imaging and spectroscopy.

abstract = {Purpose: The GE SIGNA PET/MR is a new whole body integrated time-of-flight (ToF)-PET/MR scanner from GE Healthcare. The system is capable of simultaneous PET and MR image acquisition with sub-400 ps coincidence time resolution. Simultaneous PET/MRholds great potential as a method of interrogating molecular, functional, and anatomical parameters in clinical disease in one study. Despite the complementary imaging capabilities of PET and MRI, their respective hardware tends to be incompatible due to mutual interference. In this work, the GE SIGNA PET/MR is evaluated in terms of PET performance and the potential effects of interference from MRI operation. Methods: The NEMA NU 2-2012 protocol was followed to measure PET performance parameters including spatial resolution, noise equivalent count rate, sensitivity, accuracy, and image quality. Each of these tests was performed both with the MR subsystem idle and with continuous MR pulsing for the duration of the PET data acquisition. Most measurements were repeated at three separate test sites where the system is installed. Results: The scanner has achieved an average of 4.4, 4.1, and 5.3 mm full width at half maximum radial, tangential, and axial spatial resolutions, respectively, at 1 cm from the transaxial FOV center. The peak noise equivalent count rate (NECR) of 218 kcps and a scatter fraction of 43.6% are reached at an activity concentration of 17.8 kBq/ml. Sensitivity at the center position is 23.3 cps/kBq. The maximum relative slice count rate error below peak NECR was 3.3%, and the residual error from attenuation and scatter corrections was 3.6%. Continuous MR pulsing had either no effect or a minor effect on each measurement. Conclusions: Performance measurements of the ToF-PET whole body GE SIGNA PET/MR system indicate that it is a promising new simultaneous imaging platform.},

abstract = {A recent entry into the rapidly evolving field of integrated PET/MR scanners is presented in this paper: a whole body hybrid PET/MR system (SIGNA PET/MR, GE Healthcare) capable of simultaneous acquisition of both time-of-flight (TOF) PET and high resolution MR data. The PET ring was integrated into an existing 3T MR system resulting in a (patient) bore opening of 60 cm diameter, with a 25 cm axial FOV. PET performance was evaluated both on the standalone PET ring and on the same detector integrated into the MR system, to assess the level of mutual interference between both subsystems. In both configurations we obtained detector performance data. PET detector performance was not significantly affected by integration into the MR system. The global energy resolution was within 2% (10.3% versus 10.5%), and the system coincidence time resolution showed a maximum change of < 3% (385 ps versus 394 ps) when measured outside MR and during simultaneous PET/MRI acquisitions, respectively. To evaluate PET image quality and resolution, the NEMA IQ phantom was acquired with MR idle and with MR active. Impact of PET on MR IQ was assessed by comparing SNR with PET acquisition on and off. B0 and B1 homogeneities were acquired before and after the integration of the PET ring inside the magnet. In vivo brain and whole body head-to-thighs data were acquired to demonstrate clinical image quality.},

@article{Vandenberghe2020,
abstract = {The idea of a very sensitive positron emission tomography (PET) system covering a large portion of the body of a patient already dates back to the early 1990s. In the period 2000–2010, only some prototypes with long axial field of view (FOV) have been built, which never resulted in systems used for clinical research. One of the reasons was the limitations in the available detector technology, which did not yet have sufficient energy resolution, timing resolution or countrate capabilities for fully exploiting the benefits of a long axial FOV design. PET was also not yet as widespread as it is today: the growth in oncology, which has become the major application of PET, appeared only after the introduction of PET-CT (early 2000).The detector technology used in most clinical PET systems today has a combination of good energy and timing resolution with higher countrate capabilities and has now been used since more than a decade to build time-of-flight (TOF) PET systems with fully 3D acquisitions. Based on this technology, one can construct total body PET systems and the remaining challenges (data handling, fast image reconstruction, detector cooling) are mostly related to engineering. The direct benefits of long axial FOV systems are mostly related to the higher sensitivity. For single organ imaging, the gain is close to the point source sensitivity which increases linearly with the axial length until it is limited by solid angle and attenuation of the body. The gains for single organ (compared to a fully 3D PET 20-cm axial FOV) are limited to a factor 3–4. But for long objects (like body scans), it increases quadratically with scanner length and factors of 10–40 × higher sensitivity are predicted for the long axial FOV scanner. This application of PET has seen a major increase (mostly in oncology) during the last 2 decades and is now the main type of study in a PET centre. As the technology is available and the full body concept also seems to match with existing applications, the old concept of a total body PET scanner is seeing a clear revival. Several research groups are working on this concept and after showing the potential via extensive simulations; construction of these systems has started about 2 years ago. In the first phase, two PET systems with long axial FOV suitable for large animal imaging were constructed to explore the potential in more experimental settings. Recently, the first completed total body PET systems for human use, a 70-cm-long system, called PennPET Explorer, and a 2-m-long system, called uExplorer, have become reality and first clinical studies have been shown. These results illustrate the large potential of this concept with regard to low-dose imaging, faster scanning, whole-body dynamic imaging and follow-up of tracers over longer periods. This large range of possible technical improvements seems to have the potential to change the current clinical routine and to expand the number of clinical applications of molecular imaging. The J-PET prototype is a prototype system with a long axial FOV built from axially arranged plastic scintillator strips.This paper gives an overview of the recent technical developments with regard to PET scanners with a long axial FOV covering at least the majority of the body (so called total body PET systems). After explaining the benefits and challenges of total body PET systems, the different total body PET system designs proposed for large animal and clinical imaging are described in detail. The axial length is one of the major factors determining the total cost of the system, but there are also other options in detector technology, design and processing for reducing the cost these systems. The limitations and advantages of different designs for research and clinical use are discussed taking into account potential applications and the increased cost of these systems.},

@article{Cherry2017,
abstract = {PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4-5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world's first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article , we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET. Al l nuclear medicine studies in humans are limited by the trade-offs between the number of detected decay events, imaging time, and absorbed dose. The number of detected events determines the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the final image, but constraints on administered activity, as well as high random event rates and dead time that occur at high activities, currently prevent acquisition of high-SNR images in short times. This in turn limits the ability to perform high-resolution, dynamic imaging studies with tracer kinetic modeling, because short-time-frame datasets are always noisy. A further limitation is that although the tracer injection is systemic and radiotracer is present in the entire body, current imaging systems contain only a small portion of the body within the field of view (FOV). For applications in which the distribution of radiotracer in the entire body or multiple organ systems is of interest, this limitation leads to further inefficiencies and makes it difficult to acquire dynamic data from all the tissues of interest. If one takes whole-body PET scanning with 18 F-FDG as an example, the total efficiency with which pairs of coincidence photons that escape the body are detected is well under 1% even on today's best scanners. Simplistically, this number can be derived by considering that the average geometric sensitivity within the FOV of a typical clinical PET scanner is under 5% and that with an axial coverage of 20 cm, less than an eighth of the body is in the FOV at any one time. In this article, we discuss how improving the geometric coverage directly increases sensitivity by over an order of magnitude for total-body PET scans. We describe progress to date on building the first prototype total-body scanner that will show a roughly 40-fold sensitivity gain over existing PET scanners for imaging the entire body. We also discuss how such a large increase in effective sensitivity has the potential to dramatically broaden the utility of PET in human medical research, potentially leading to new clinical applications, as well as how it can positively affect existing clinical applications. Finally, we describe how anticipated improvements in timing resolution can produce further increases in effective sensitivity, leading to the prospect of PET scanners that are about 200 times more sensitive than current commercial systems for total-body imaging. FROM WHOLE-BODY PET TO TOTAL-BODY PET There are two major factors contributing to the extremely poor sensitivity (,1%) for current whole-body PET scans (Fig. 1A). The first and most obvious is that at any one time, roughly 85%-90% of the body is outside the FOV of the scanner and no signal from these regions of the body is collected. Second, even for the tissues and organs within the scanner FOV, no more than about 3%-5% of the available signal (photon pairs that escape the body without being attenuated or scattered) can be collected, because the radiation is emitted isotopically and most does not intercept the detector rings. Both factors are addressed by extending the detector rings so that they cover the entire body (Fig. 1B). This concept, which we call total-body PET, allows almost maximal detection of the radiation emitted from the body. Computer simulations of a cylindric phantom approximating the dimensions of the adult human predict that extending a PET scanner from a typical 20-cm axial FOV to a 200-cm FOV leads to an approximately 40-fold increase in the effective sensitivity (as measured by the noise-equivalent counting rate) for imaging the body from},

abstract = {Within the EXPLORER Consortium, the construction of the world's first total-body PET/CT scanner has recently been completed. The 194-cm axial field of view of the EXPLORER PET/CT scanner is sufficient to cover, for the first time, the entire human adult body in a single acquisition in more than 99% of the population and allows total-body pharmacokinetic studies with frame durations as short as 1 s. The large increase in sensitivity arising from total-body coverage as well as increased solid angle for detection at any point within the body allows whole-body 18 F-FDG PET studies to be acquired with unprecedented count density, improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the resulting images. Alternatively, the sensitivity gain can be used to acquire diagnostic PET images with very small amounts of activity in the field of view (25 MBq, 0.7 mCi or less), with very short acquisition times (∼1 min or less) or at later time points after the tracer's administration. We report here on the first human imaging studies on the EXPLORER scanner using a range of different protocols that provide initial evidence in support of these claims. These case studies provide the foundation for future carefully controlled trials to quantitatively evaluate the improvements possible through total-body PET imaging.},

Their use, instead of voxels, introduces additional parameters which enable the user to control the shape of the volume element (blob) and consequently to control the characteristics of the images produced by iterative methods for reconstruction from projection data. For images composed of blobs, efficient algorithms have been designed for the projection and discrete back-projection operations, which are the crucial parts of iterative reconstruction methods. We have investigated the relationship between the values of the blob parameters and the properties of images represented by the blobs. Experiments show that using blobs in iterative reconstruction methods leads to substantial improvement in the reconstruction performance, based on visual quality and on quantitative measures, in comparison with the voxel case. The images reconstructed using appropriately chosen blobs are characterized by less image noise for both noiseless data and noisy data, without loss of image resolution. {\textcopyright} 1996 IEEE.},

abstract = {Ready availability has prompted the use of computed tomography (CT) data in various applications in radiation therapy. For example, some radiation treatment planning systems now utilize CT data in heterogeneous dose calculation algorithms. In radiotherapy imaging applications, CT data are projected onto specified planes, thus producing “radiographs,” which are compared with simulator radiographs to assist in proper patient positioning and delineation of target volumes. All these applications share the common geometric problem of evaluating the radiological path through the CT array. Due to the complexity of the three dimensional geometry and the enormous amount of CT data, the exact evaluation of the radiological path has proven to be a time consuming and difficult problem. This paper identifies the inefficient aspect of the traditional exact evaluation of the radiological path as that of treating the CT data as individual voxels. Rather than individual voxels, a new exact algorithm is presented that considers the CT data as consisting of the intersection volumes of three orthogonal sets of equally spaced, parallel planes. For a three dimensional CT array of N3 voxels, the new exact algorithm scales with 3N, the number of planes, rather than N3, the number of voxels. Coded in fortran 77 on a VAX 11/780 with a floating point option, the algorithm requires approximately 5 ms to calculate an average radiological path in a 1003 voxel array. {\textcopyright} 1983, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

@article{Joseph1982,
abstract = {It is often desired to calculate line integrals through a field of reconstructed CT density pixels for the purpose of improving CT image quality. Two algorithms widely published and discussed in the past are known to either degrade spatial resolution or generate errors in the results due to the discontinuous “square pixel” modeling of the reconstructed image. An algorithm is described, based on linear interpolation between pixels, which provides superior accuracy without unnecessary loss of resolution. It was tested on simulated data for a head section and on a narrow Gaussian density distribution. The experimental results demonstrated improved performance. The method is expected to prove useful for many types of post-reconstruction processing, including beam hardening, missing data, and noise supression algorithms.

@article{Moehrs2008,
abstract = {Iterative image reconstruction algorithms for positron emission tomography (PET) require a sophisticated system matrix (model) of the scanner. Our aim is to set up such a model offline for the YAP-(S)PET II small animal imaging tomograph in order to use it subsequently with standard ML-EM (maximum-likelihood expectation maximization) and OSEM (ordered subset expectation maximization) for fully three-dimensional image reconstruction. In general, the system model can be obtained analytically, via measurements or via Monte Carlo simulations. In this paper, we present the multi-ray method, which can be considered as a hybrid method to set up the system model offline. It incorporates accurate analytical (geometric) considerations as well as crystal depth and crystal scatter effects. At the same time, it has the potential to model seamlessly other physical aspects such as the positron range. The proposed method is based on multiple rays which are traced from/to the detector crystals through the image volume. Such a ray-tracing approach itself is not new; however, we derive a novel mathematical formulation of the approach and investigate the positioning of the integration (ray-end) points. First, we study single system matrix entries and show that the positioning and weighting of the ray-end points according to Gaussian integration give better results compared to equally spaced integration points (trapezoidal integration), especially if only a small number of integration points (rays) are used. Additionally, we show that, for a given variance of the single matrix entries, the number of rays (events) required to calculate the whole matrix is a factor of 20 larger when using a pure Monte-Carlo-based method. Finally, we analyse the quality of the model by reconstructing phantom data from the YAP-(S)PET II scanner. {\textcopyright} 2008 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

abstract = {We present the results of testing a previously presented algorithm for three-dimensional image reconstruction that uses all gamma-ray coincidence events detected by a PET volume-imaging scanner. By using two iterations of an analytic filter-backprojection method, the algorithm is not constrained by the requirement of a spatially invariant detector point spread function, which limits normal analytic techniques. Removing this constraint allows the incorporation of all detected events, regardless of orientation, which improves the statistical quality of the final reconstructed image. {\textcopyright} 1989 IEEE},

@article{Vardi1985,
abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET)-still in its research stages-is a technique that promises to open new medical fronters by enabling physicans to study the metabolic activity of the body in a pictorial manner. Much as in X-ray transmission tomography and other modes of computerized tomography, quality of the reconstructed image in PET is very sensitive to the mathematical algorithm to be used for reconsruction. In this article, we tailor a methematical model to tbe physics of positron emissions, adn we use the model to describe the basic image reconstruction problem of PET as a standard problem in statistical estimation from incomplete data. We describe various estimation procedures, such as maximum likelihood (ML) method (using the EM algorithm), the method of moments, and the least squares methods. A computer simulation of a PET experiment is then used to demonstrate the ML and the least squares reconstructions. The main purposes of this articel are to repoet on what we believe is an important contribution of statistics to PET and to familiatize statisticians with this exciting field that can benefit from further statistical methodologies to be developed with PET problem in mind. Thus no background in pgysics or previous knowledge of computerized tomography is assumed.The emphasis is on the basic PET medel and the statistical methodology needed for it.},

@article{Lange1984,
abstract = {Two proposed likelihood models for emission and transmission image reconstruction accurately incorporate the Poisson nature of photon counting noise and a number of other relevant physical features. As in most algebraic schemes, the region to be reconstructed is divided into small pixels. For each pixel a concentration or attentuation coefficient must be estimated. In the maximum likelihood approach these parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood (probability of the observations). EM algorithms are iterative techniques for finding maximum likelihood estimates. In this paper we discuss the general principles behind all EM algorithms and derive in detail the specific algorithms for emission and transmission tomography. The virtues of the EM algorithms include (a) accurate incorporation of a good physical model, (b) automatic inclusion of non-negativity constraints on all parameters, (c) an excellent measure of the quality of a reconstruction, and (d) global convergence to a single vector of parameter estimates. We discuss the specification of necessary physical features such as source and detector geometries. Actual reconstructions are deferred to a later time.},

@article{Wang2010,
abstract = {Parametric imaging using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) provides important information for biological research and clinical diagnosis. Indirect and direct methods have been developed for reconstructing linear parametric images from dynamic PET data. Indirect methods are relatively simple and easy to implement because the image reconstruction and kinetic modeling are performed in two separate steps. Direct methods estimate parametric images directly from raw PET data and are statistically more efficient. However, the convergence rate of direct algorithms can be slow due to the coupling between the reconstruction and kinetic modeling. Here we present two fast gradient-type algorithms for direct reconstruction of linear parametric images. The new algorithms decouple the reconstruction and linear parametric modeling at each iteration by employing the principle of optimization transfer. Convergence speed is accelerated by running more sub-iterations of linear parametric estimation because the computation cost of the linear parametric modeling is much less than that of the image reconstruction. Computer simulation studies demonstrated that the new algorithms converge much faster than the traditional expectation maximization (EM) and the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithms for dynamic PET.},
