abstract = {The generalized linear least squares (GLLS) algorithm has been found useful in image-wide parameter estimation for the generation of parametric images with positron emission tomography (PET) as it is computationally efficient and statistically reliable. However, the original algorithm was designed for parameter estimation with non-uniformly sampled instantaneous measurements. When dynamic PET data are sampled with the optimal image sampling schedule (OISS) to reduce memory and storage space, only a few temporal image frames are recorded. As a result, the direct application of GLLS is no longer appropriate. In this paper, we extend the GLLS algorithm to a five parameter model for the study of human brain metabolism, which accounts for the effect of cerebral blood volume (CBV), using OISS sampled data, with as few as five temporal samples. The formulation for this new GLLS algorithm is developed, and its computational efficiency and statistical reliability are investigated and validated using computer simulations and clinical PET [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) data. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {A kinetic modelling method for the determination of influx constant, Ki is given that utilises basis functions derived from plasma input two-tissue compartmental models (BAFPIC). Two forms of the basis functions are given: BAFPICI with k4=0 (no product loss) and BAFPICR with k4 non-zero. Simulations were performed using literature rate constant values for [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in both normal and abnormal brain pathology. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous tissues were simulated and this data was also used as input for other methods commonly used to determine Ki: non-linear least squares compartmental modelling (NLLS), autoradiographic method and Patlak-Gjedde graphical analysis (PGA). The four methods were also compared for real FDG positron emission tomography (PET) data. For both k4=0 and k4 non-zero simulated data BAFPIC had the best bias properties of the four methods. The autoradiographic method was always the best for variability but BAFPICI had lower variability than PGA and NLLS. For non-zero k4 data, the variance of BAFPICR was inferior to PGA but still significantly superior to NLLS. Ki maps calculated from real data substantiate the simulation results, with BAFPICI having lower noise than PGA. Voxel Ki values from BAFPICI correlated well with those from PGA (r2=0.989). BAFPIC is easy to implement and combines low bias with good noise properties for voxel-wise determination of Ki for FDG. BAFPIC is suitable for determining Ki for other tracers well characterised by a serial two-tissue compartment model and has the advantage of also producing values for individual kinetic constants and blood volume. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Cunningham1993,
abstract = {We describe a new technique for the analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies in humans, where data consist of the time courses of label in tissue regions of interest and in arterial blood, following the administration of radiolabelled tracers. The technique produces a simple spectrum of the kinetic components which relate the tissue's response to the blood activity curve. From this summary of the kinetic components, the tissue's unit impulse response can be derived. The convolution of the arterial input function with the derived unit impulse response function gives the curve of best fit to the observed tissue data. The analysis makes no a priori assumptions regarding the number of compartments or components required to describe the time course of label in the tissue. Rather, it is based on a general linear model, presented here in a formulation compatible with its solution using standard computer algorithms. Its application is illustrated with reference to cerebral blood flow, glucose utilization, and ligand binding. The interpretation of the spectra, and of the tissue unit impulse response functions, are discussed in terms of vascular components, unidirectional clearance of tracer by the tissue, and reversible and irreversible phenomena. The significance of the number of components which can be identified within a given datum set is also discussed. The technique facilitates the interpretation of dynamic PET data and simplifies comparisons between regions and between subjects.},

abstract = {With the increased interest in new PET tracers, gene-targeted therapy, immunoPET, and theranostics, other radioisotopes will be increasingly used in clinical PET scanners, in addition to 18F. Some of the most interesting radioisotopes with prospective use in the new fields are not pure short-range $\beta$+ emitters but can be associated with gamma emissions in coincidence with the annihilation radiation (prompt gamma), gamma-gamma cascades, intense Bremsstrahlung radiation, high-energy positrons that may escape out of the patient skin, and high-energy gamma rays that result in some e+/e− pair production. The high level of sophistication in data correction and excellent quantitative accuracy that has been reached for 18F in recent years can be questioned by these effects. In this work, we review the physics and the scientific literature and evaluate the effect of these additional phenomena on the PET data for each of a series of radioisotopes: 11C, 13N, 15O, 18F, 64Cu, 68Ga, 76Br, 82Rb, 86Y, 89Zr, 90Y, and 124I. In particular, we discuss the present complications arising from the prompt gammas, and we review the scientific literature on prompt gamma correction. For some of the radioisotopes considered in this work, prompt gamma correction is definitely needed to assure acceptable image quality, and several approaches have been proposed in recent years. Bremsstrahlung photons and 176Lu background were also evaluated.},

The objective of this paper is to provide the reader with the terminology and understanding of how PET data are acquired and orga-nized as well as the issues involved in choosing one ap-proach over another. Sinograms and projection views will be presented as methods of storing and viewing raw PET data. Different approaches to increase axial sampling while main-taining a sufficient number of counts for each reconstructed slice are discussed, as well as the use of sinogram com-pression or " mashing " to reduce the storage requirements of raw PET data. The differences between 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) PET and how storage of raw 3D data may differ from that of 2D data are described. The concept of " Michelograms " as a means of displaying the nature of the axial sampling in both 2D and 3D PET is discussed. After reading this paper, the reader will be able to describe 2 methods used to store and display raw PET data and com-pare them with methods used in SPECT. The reader will be able to define the terms " span " and " maximum ring differ-ence " and describe how they relate to the axial sampling in 2D and 3D PET. The reader will also be able to list 3 ways in which 3D PET differs from 2D PET.},

The advancements that have benchmarked PET progress are the result of key components that include human intellect and passion for PET technology, relentless persuasion of key political forces to eliminate the barriers precluding PET usage, tireless efforts to raise awareness about PET and a crucial network of support throughout the PET community. This article sets forth a timeline of significant events that have contributed to the development of PET as it is known today. It introduces the earliest physicist and physician, for instance, who were responsible for the first medical applications for positron emitting radioisotopes using a simple brain probe that utilized coincidence to localize brain tumors. Additionally, it identifies landmark technological achievements that have helped pave the way to modern PET. This study includes historical accounts surrounding the use of the first human PET tomograph, discovery of the Bismuth Germanate (BGO) scintillator, development of the Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET method, the design of the first PET medical cyclotron with automated chemistry and operated by a PC and a technologist, Food and Drug Administration's approval of FDG, HCFA reimbursement, and the capacity of Lutetium Oxyorthosilicate (LSO) to produce a revolutionary advance in PET scanners. The main thrust of this article is to recognize via a timeline of PET accomplishments the noteworthy work of scientists, physicians and others who have been key players in various aspects of the continuous activity to move PET technology forward from invention to research, and to become a major clinical imaging modality.},

abstract = {Methods for whole-body PET imaging have been developed to provide a clinical tool for the detection and evaluation of primary and metastatic cancers. The axial FOV of the PET system is extended by imaging at multiple bed positions to cover the whole body. In typical rectilinear PET scans, only a small fraction of the data is collected to form two-dimensional projection images. In this work, 100% of the projection data was collected to form the two-dimensional projection images. These projection images were generated for continuous angles over 180° by resorting sinogram data. In addition, tomographic images were formed by using filtered backprojection reconstruction without attenuation correction. Coronal and sagittal cuts were then extracted from the three-dimensional data set. The tomographic images were reconstructed to a resolution of 10.8 mm in all dimensions because of statistical limitations of the data. Both methods of image formation resulted in images of high quality with the tomographic reconstruction providing the highest contrast and resolution. An acquisition time of 1-2 min/bed position after a 10-mCi injection of [18F]fluoride ion or [18F]FDG was found to give a sufficient number of counts for producing images of good resolution and contrast, from a total scanning time of 32-64 min.},

The goal of this work is to determine if we can perform attenuation correction of the PET emission data using accurately aligned CT attenuation information. We discuss possible methods of calculating the PET attenuation map at 511 keV based on CT transmission information acquired from 40 keV through 140 keV. Data were acquired on separate CT and PET scanners and were aligned using standard image registration procedures. Results are presented on three of the attenuation calculation methods: segmentation, scaling, and our proposed hybrid segmentation/scaling method. The results are compared with those using the standard 3D PET attenuation correction method as a gold standard. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed hybrid method for converting the CT attenuation map from an effective CT photon energy of 70 keV to the PET photon energy of 511 keV. We conclude that using CT information is a feasible way to obtain attenuation correction factors for 3D PET.},

abstract = {Hybrid PET/MR systems have rapidly progressed from the prototype stage to systems that are increasingly being used in the clinics. This review provides an overview of developments in hybrid PET/MR systems and summarizes the current state of the art in PET/MR instrumentation, correction techniques, and data analysis. The strong magnetic field requires considerable changes in the manner by which PET images are acquired and has led, among others, to the development of new PET detectors, such as silicon photomultipliers. During more than a decade of active PET/MR development, several system designs have been described. The technical background of combined PET/MR systems is explained and related challenges are discussed. The necessity for PET attenuation correction required new methods based on MR data. Therefore, an overview of recent developments in this field is provided. Furthermore, MR-based motion correction techniques for PET are discussed, as integrated PET/MR systems provide a platform for measuring motion with high temporal resolution without additional instrumentation. The MR component in PET/MR systems can provide functional information about disease processes or brain function alongside anatomic images. Against this background, we point out new opportunities for data analysis in this new field of multimodal molecular imaging.

abstract = {Objectives Technical performance evaluation of a human brain PET/MRI system. Methods The magnetic field compatible positron emission tomography (PET) insert is based on avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays coupled with lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) crystals and slip-fits into a slightly modified clinical 3-T MRI system. The mutual interference between the two imaging techniques was minimised by the careful design of the hardware to maintain the quality of the B0 and B1 field homogeneity. Results The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the homogeneity of the MR images were minimally influenced by the presence of the PET. Measurements according to the Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) protocol proved the combined system's ability to perform functional MRI (fMRI). The performance of the PET insert was evaluated according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standard. The noise equivalent count rate (NEC) peaked at 30.7×103 counts/s at 7.3 kBq/mL. The point source sensitivity was greater than 7 %. The spatial resolution in the centre field of view was less than 3 mm. Patient data sets clearly revealed a noticeably good PET and MR image quality. Conclusion PET and MRI phantom tests and first patient data exhibit the device's potential for simultaneous multiparametric imaging. Key Points ̇ Combination of PET and MRI is a new emerging imaging technology. ̇ Evaluated brain PET/MRI enables uncompromised imaging performance. ̇ PET/MRI aims to provide multiparametric imaging allowing acquisition of morphology and metabolism. {\textcopyright} European Society of Radiology 2012.},

abstract = {The recently released Biograph mMR is the first commercially available integrated whole-body PET/MR scanner. There are considerable advantages to integrating both modalities in a single scanner that enables truly simultaneous acquisition. However, there are also concerns about the possible degradation of both PET and MR performance in an integrated system. This paper evaluates the performance of the Biograph mMR during independent and simultaneous acquisition of PET and morphologic MR data. Methods: The NEMA NU 2-2007 protocol was followed for studying the PET performance. The following measurements were performed: spatial resolution; scatter fraction, count losses, and randoms; sensitivity; accuracy of the correction for count losses and randoms; and image quality. The quality control manual of the American College of Radiology was followed for studying the MR performance. The following measurements were performed: geometric accuracy, spatial resolution, low-contrast detectability, signal-to-noise ratio, static field (B 0) homogeneity, radiofrequency field (B 1) homogeneity, and radiofrequency noise. Results: An average spatial resolution of 4.3 mm in full width at half maximum was measured at 1 cm offset from the center of the field of view. The system sensitivity was 15.0 kcps/MBq along the center of the scanner. The scatter fraction was 37.9%, and the peak noise-equivalent count rate was 184 kcps at 23.1 kBq/mL. The maximum absolute value of the relative count rate error due to dead-time losses and randoms was 5.5%. The average residual error in scatter and attenuation correction was 12.1%. All MR parameters were within the tolerances defined by the American College of Radiology. B 0 inhomogeneities below 1 ppm were measured in a 120-mm radius. B 1 homogeneity and signal-to-noise ratio were equivalent to those of a standard MR scanner. No radiofrequency interference was detected. Conclusion: These results compare favorably with other state-of-the-art PET/CT and PET/MR scanners, indicating that the integration of the PET detectors in the MR scanner and their operation within the magnetic field do not have a perceptible impact on the overall performance. The MR subsystem performs essentially like a standalone system. However, further work is necessary to evaluate the more advanced MR applications, such as functional imaging and spectroscopy.

abstract = {Purpose: The GE SIGNA PET/MR is a new whole body integrated time-of-flight (ToF)-PET/MR scanner from GE Healthcare. The system is capable of simultaneous PET and MR image acquisition with sub-400 ps coincidence time resolution. Simultaneous PET/MRholds great potential as a method of interrogating molecular, functional, and anatomical parameters in clinical disease in one study. Despite the complementary imaging capabilities of PET and MRI, their respective hardware tends to be incompatible due to mutual interference. In this work, the GE SIGNA PET/MR is evaluated in terms of PET performance and the potential effects of interference from MRI operation. Methods: The NEMA NU 2-2012 protocol was followed to measure PET performance parameters including spatial resolution, noise equivalent count rate, sensitivity, accuracy, and image quality. Each of these tests was performed both with the MR subsystem idle and with continuous MR pulsing for the duration of the PET data acquisition. Most measurements were repeated at three separate test sites where the system is installed. Results: The scanner has achieved an average of 4.4, 4.1, and 5.3 mm full width at half maximum radial, tangential, and axial spatial resolutions, respectively, at 1 cm from the transaxial FOV center. The peak noise equivalent count rate (NECR) of 218 kcps and a scatter fraction of 43.6% are reached at an activity concentration of 17.8 kBq/ml. Sensitivity at the center position is 23.3 cps/kBq. The maximum relative slice count rate error below peak NECR was 3.3%, and the residual error from attenuation and scatter corrections was 3.6%. Continuous MR pulsing had either no effect or a minor effect on each measurement. Conclusions: Performance measurements of the ToF-PET whole body GE SIGNA PET/MR system indicate that it is a promising new simultaneous imaging platform.},

abstract = {A recent entry into the rapidly evolving field of integrated PET/MR scanners is presented in this paper: a whole body hybrid PET/MR system (SIGNA PET/MR, GE Healthcare) capable of simultaneous acquisition of both time-of-flight (TOF) PET and high resolution MR data. The PET ring was integrated into an existing 3T MR system resulting in a (patient) bore opening of 60 cm diameter, with a 25 cm axial FOV. PET performance was evaluated both on the standalone PET ring and on the same detector integrated into the MR system, to assess the level of mutual interference between both subsystems. In both configurations we obtained detector performance data. PET detector performance was not significantly affected by integration into the MR system. The global energy resolution was within 2% (10.3% versus 10.5%), and the system coincidence time resolution showed a maximum change of < 3% (385 ps versus 394 ps) when measured outside MR and during simultaneous PET/MRI acquisitions, respectively. To evaluate PET image quality and resolution, the NEMA IQ phantom was acquired with MR idle and with MR active. Impact of PET on MR IQ was assessed by comparing SNR with PET acquisition on and off. B0 and B1 homogeneities were acquired before and after the integration of the PET ring inside the magnet. In vivo brain and whole body head-to-thighs data were acquired to demonstrate clinical image quality.},

@article{Vandenberghe2020,
abstract = {The idea of a very sensitive positron emission tomography (PET) system covering a large portion of the body of a patient already dates back to the early 1990s. In the period 2000–2010, only some prototypes with long axial field of view (FOV) have been built, which never resulted in systems used for clinical research. One of the reasons was the limitations in the available detector technology, which did not yet have sufficient energy resolution, timing resolution or countrate capabilities for fully exploiting the benefits of a long axial FOV design. PET was also not yet as widespread as it is today: the growth in oncology, which has become the major application of PET, appeared only after the introduction of PET-CT (early 2000).The detector technology used in most clinical PET systems today has a combination of good energy and timing resolution with higher countrate capabilities and has now been used since more than a decade to build time-of-flight (TOF) PET systems with fully 3D acquisitions. Based on this technology, one can construct total body PET systems and the remaining challenges (data handling, fast image reconstruction, detector cooling) are mostly related to engineering. The direct benefits of long axial FOV systems are mostly related to the higher sensitivity. For single organ imaging, the gain is close to the point source sensitivity which increases linearly with the axial length until it is limited by solid angle and attenuation of the body. The gains for single organ (compared to a fully 3D PET 20-cm axial FOV) are limited to a factor 3–4. But for long objects (like body scans), it increases quadratically with scanner length and factors of 10–40 × higher sensitivity are predicted for the long axial FOV scanner. This application of PET has seen a major increase (mostly in oncology) during the last 2 decades and is now the main type of study in a PET centre. As the technology is available and the full body concept also seems to match with existing applications, the old concept of a total body PET scanner is seeing a clear revival. Several research groups are working on this concept and after showing the potential via extensive simulations; construction of these systems has started about 2 years ago. In the first phase, two PET systems with long axial FOV suitable for large animal imaging were constructed to explore the potential in more experimental settings. Recently, the first completed total body PET systems for human use, a 70-cm-long system, called PennPET Explorer, and a 2-m-long system, called uExplorer, have become reality and first clinical studies have been shown. These results illustrate the large potential of this concept with regard to low-dose imaging, faster scanning, whole-body dynamic imaging and follow-up of tracers over longer periods. This large range of possible technical improvements seems to have the potential to change the current clinical routine and to expand the number of clinical applications of molecular imaging. The J-PET prototype is a prototype system with a long axial FOV built from axially arranged plastic scintillator strips.This paper gives an overview of the recent technical developments with regard to PET scanners with a long axial FOV covering at least the majority of the body (so called total body PET systems). After explaining the benefits and challenges of total body PET systems, the different total body PET system designs proposed for large animal and clinical imaging are described in detail. The axial length is one of the major factors determining the total cost of the system, but there are also other options in detector technology, design and processing for reducing the cost these systems. The limitations and advantages of different designs for research and clinical use are discussed taking into account potential applications and the increased cost of these systems.},

@article{Cherry2017,
abstract = {PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4-5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world's first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article , we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET. Al l nuclear medicine studies in humans are limited by the trade-offs between the number of detected decay events, imaging time, and absorbed dose. The number of detected events determines the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the final image, but constraints on administered activity, as well as high random event rates and dead time that occur at high activities, currently prevent acquisition of high-SNR images in short times. This in turn limits the ability to perform high-resolution, dynamic imaging studies with tracer kinetic modeling, because short-time-frame datasets are always noisy. A further limitation is that although the tracer injection is systemic and radiotracer is present in the entire body, current imaging systems contain only a small portion of the body within the field of view (FOV). For applications in which the distribution of radiotracer in the entire body or multiple organ systems is of interest, this limitation leads to further inefficiencies and makes it difficult to acquire dynamic data from all the tissues of interest. If one takes whole-body PET scanning with 18 F-FDG as an example, the total efficiency with which pairs of coincidence photons that escape the body are detected is well under 1% even on today's best scanners. Simplistically, this number can be derived by considering that the average geometric sensitivity within the FOV of a typical clinical PET scanner is under 5% and that with an axial coverage of 20 cm, less than an eighth of the body is in the FOV at any one time. In this article, we discuss how improving the geometric coverage directly increases sensitivity by over an order of magnitude for total-body PET scans. We describe progress to date on building the first prototype total-body scanner that will show a roughly 40-fold sensitivity gain over existing PET scanners for imaging the entire body. We also discuss how such a large increase in effective sensitivity has the potential to dramatically broaden the utility of PET in human medical research, potentially leading to new clinical applications, as well as how it can positively affect existing clinical applications. Finally, we describe how anticipated improvements in timing resolution can produce further increases in effective sensitivity, leading to the prospect of PET scanners that are about 200 times more sensitive than current commercial systems for total-body imaging. FROM WHOLE-BODY PET TO TOTAL-BODY PET There are two major factors contributing to the extremely poor sensitivity (,1%) for current whole-body PET scans (Fig. 1A). The first and most obvious is that at any one time, roughly 85%-90% of the body is outside the FOV of the scanner and no signal from these regions of the body is collected. Second, even for the tissues and organs within the scanner FOV, no more than about 3%-5% of the available signal (photon pairs that escape the body without being attenuated or scattered) can be collected, because the radiation is emitted isotopically and most does not intercept the detector rings. Both factors are addressed by extending the detector rings so that they cover the entire body (Fig. 1B). This concept, which we call total-body PET, allows almost maximal detection of the radiation emitted from the body. Computer simulations of a cylindric phantom approximating the dimensions of the adult human predict that extending a PET scanner from a typical 20-cm axial FOV to a 200-cm FOV leads to an approximately 40-fold increase in the effective sensitivity (as measured by the noise-equivalent counting rate) for imaging the body from},

abstract = {Within the EXPLORER Consortium, the construction of the world's first total-body PET/CT scanner has recently been completed. The 194-cm axial field of view of the EXPLORER PET/CT scanner is sufficient to cover, for the first time, the entire human adult body in a single acquisition in more than 99% of the population and allows total-body pharmacokinetic studies with frame durations as short as 1 s. The large increase in sensitivity arising from total-body coverage as well as increased solid angle for detection at any point within the body allows whole-body 18 F-FDG PET studies to be acquired with unprecedented count density, improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the resulting images. Alternatively, the sensitivity gain can be used to acquire diagnostic PET images with very small amounts of activity in the field of view (25 MBq, 0.7 mCi or less), with very short acquisition times (∼1 min or less) or at later time points after the tracer's administration. We report here on the first human imaging studies on the EXPLORER scanner using a range of different protocols that provide initial evidence in support of these claims. These case studies provide the foundation for future carefully controlled trials to quantitatively evaluate the improvements possible through total-body PET imaging.},

Their use, instead of voxels, introduces additional parameters which enable the user to control the shape of the volume element (blob) and consequently to control the characteristics of the images produced by iterative methods for reconstruction from projection data. For images composed of blobs, efficient algorithms have been designed for the projection and discrete back-projection operations, which are the crucial parts of iterative reconstruction methods. We have investigated the relationship between the values of the blob parameters and the properties of images represented by the blobs. Experiments show that using blobs in iterative reconstruction methods leads to substantial improvement in the reconstruction performance, based on visual quality and on quantitative measures, in comparison with the voxel case. The images reconstructed using appropriately chosen blobs are characterized by less image noise for both noiseless data and noisy data, without loss of image resolution. {\textcopyright} 1996 IEEE.},

abstract = {Ready availability has prompted the use of computed tomography (CT) data in various applications in radiation therapy. For example, some radiation treatment planning systems now utilize CT data in heterogeneous dose calculation algorithms. In radiotherapy imaging applications, CT data are projected onto specified planes, thus producing “radiographs,” which are compared with simulator radiographs to assist in proper patient positioning and delineation of target volumes. All these applications share the common geometric problem of evaluating the radiological path through the CT array. Due to the complexity of the three dimensional geometry and the enormous amount of CT data, the exact evaluation of the radiological path has proven to be a time consuming and difficult problem. This paper identifies the inefficient aspect of the traditional exact evaluation of the radiological path as that of treating the CT data as individual voxels. Rather than individual voxels, a new exact algorithm is presented that considers the CT data as consisting of the intersection volumes of three orthogonal sets of equally spaced, parallel planes. For a three dimensional CT array of N3 voxels, the new exact algorithm scales with 3N, the number of planes, rather than N3, the number of voxels. Coded in fortran 77 on a VAX 11/780 with a floating point option, the algorithm requires approximately 5 ms to calculate an average radiological path in a 1003 voxel array. {\textcopyright} 1983, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Two algorithms widely published and discussed in the past are known to either degrade spatial resolution or generate errors in the results due to the discontinuous “square pixel” modeling of the reconstructed image. An algorithm is described, based on linear interpolation between pixels, which provides superior accuracy without unnecessary loss of resolution. It was tested on simulated data for a head section and on a narrow Gaussian density distribution. The experimental results demonstrated improved performance. The method is expected to prove useful for many types of post-reconstruction processing, including beam hardening, missing data, and noise supression algorithms.

abstract = {Iterative image reconstruction algorithms for positron emission tomography (PET) require a sophisticated system matrix (model) of the scanner. Our aim is to set up such a model offline for the YAP-(S)PET II small animal imaging tomograph in order to use it subsequently with standard ML-EM (maximum-likelihood expectation maximization) and OSEM (ordered subset expectation maximization) for fully three-dimensional image reconstruction. In general, the system model can be obtained analytically, via measurements or via Monte Carlo simulations. In this paper, we present the multi-ray method, which can be considered as a hybrid method to set up the system model offline. It incorporates accurate analytical (geometric) considerations as well as crystal depth and crystal scatter effects. At the same time, it has the potential to model seamlessly other physical aspects such as the positron range. The proposed method is based on multiple rays which are traced from/to the detector crystals through the image volume. Such a ray-tracing approach itself is not new; however, we derive a novel mathematical formulation of the approach and investigate the positioning of the integration (ray-end) points. First, we study single system matrix entries and show that the positioning and weighting of the ray-end points according to Gaussian integration give better results compared to equally spaced integration points (trapezoidal integration), especially if only a small number of integration points (rays) are used. Additionally, we show that, for a given variance of the single matrix entries, the number of rays (events) required to calculate the whole matrix is a factor of 20 larger when using a pure Monte-Carlo-based method. Finally, we analyse the quality of the model by reconstructing phantom data from the YAP-(S)PET II scanner. {\textcopyright} 2008 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

A computer simulation of a PET experiment is then used to demonstrate the ML and the least squares reconstructions.

EM algorithms are iterative techniques for finding maximum likelihood estimates. In this paper we discuss the general principles behind all EM algorithms and derive in detail the specific algorithms for emission and transmission tomography. The virtues of the EM algorithms include (a) accurate incorporation of a good physical model, (b) automatic inclusion of non-negativity constraints on all parameters, (c) an excellent measure of the quality of a reconstruction, and (d) global convergence to a single vector of parameter estimates.

abstract = {Parametric imaging using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) provides important information for biological research and clinical diagnosis. Indirect and direct methods have been developed for reconstructing linear parametric images from dynamic PET data. Indirect methods are relatively simple and easy to implement because the image reconstruction and kinetic modeling are performed in two separate steps. Direct methods estimate parametric images directly from raw PET data and are statistically more efficient. However, the convergence rate of direct algorithms can be slow due to the coupling between the reconstruction and kinetic modeling. Here we present two fast gradient-type algorithms for direct reconstruction of linear parametric images. The new algorithms decouple the reconstruction and linear parametric modeling at each iteration by employing the principle of optimization transfer. Convergence speed is accelerated by running more sub-iterations of linear parametric estimation because the computation cost of the linear parametric modeling is much less than that of the image reconstruction. Computer simulation studies demonstrated that the new algorithms converge much faster than the traditional expectation maximization (EM) and the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithms for dynamic PET.},

Conventionally, image reconstruction and the calculation of parametric images are performed separately. By combining both processes, low noise parametric images are obtained, bypassing the expensive computations of image reconstruction. The calculation of the images is performed by restricting the pixel time activity curves to a positive linear sum of predefined time characteristics. The weights in this sum are calculated directly from the PET projection data, using an iterative algorithm derived from a Maximum Likelihood (ML) iterative algorithm commonly used for tomographic reconstruction. Combining reconstruction and parametric estimation also produces a computational advantage. The ability of the algorithm to extract known kinetic components from the raw data is assessed, using data from both a phantom experiment and from clinical studies. The calculated parametric images indicate differential kinetic behaviour and have been used to aid in the identification of tissues which exhibit variations in the handling of labelled compounds.},

Subsequent pixel-by-pixel application of the appropriate kinetic model provides quantitative information in terms of images of the distribution of the physiological parameter of interest. In this context, iterative reconstruction methods may be used to reconstruct for each time frame a static image of appreciable higher quality than the analytical algorithms, especially in low-count cases. Furthermore, if the reconstruction algorithm also models the kinetics of the measured counts, the parametric image is expected to be of even higher quality. In this work, we investigate the methodology to directly reconstruct parametric images in three-dimensional PET when the kinetic model is linear in its parameters (Patlak plot) and compare with indirectly estimated parametric maps, where the radioactivity distribution was estimated by the filtered back projection and ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithms. Both real and simulated data for tracers with irreversible kinetics in brain studies are included. The results demonstrate appreciable smaller standard deviation and mean squared error characteristics for the direct reconstruction. However, some regions may converge slowly. The FBP and ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) indirect estimations have a similar level of bias after matching their resolutions, but OSEM has smaller standard deviation. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

abstract = {Fully 40 image reconstruction, through its use of temporally extensive basis functions, is able to reduce spatiotemporal noise in dynamic PET imaging. This noise reduction has the potential to benefit post-reconstruction kinetic analysis, resulting in improved parametric images. However these benefits come at a significant computational cost: fully 40 reconstruction requires access to the entire time series of fully 30 sinograms (along with the same number of fully 30 scatter and randoms sinogram estimates) in the innermost iterative reconstruction loop. This results in a huge in-memory storage requirement combined with a projection/backprojection workload in the innermost reconstruction loop which is up to 1040 times greater than conventional static 30 reconstruction (depending on the number of frames). This work presents a practical 40 methodology which i) uses an extremely efficient symmetry \& SIMO forward and backprojector for ultra fast computation, ii) compresses the time series of dynamic sonogram data sets without information loss, and iii) permits the use of any user-specified set of temporal basis functions. The result is an extremely fast and flexible fully 40 iterative reconstruction methodology, greatly facilitating the determination of the (perhaps study-specific) optimal temporal basis functions. Whereas single CPU processing for fully 40 list-mode data reconstruction can take in excess of 2 weeks on a single node, the proposed method (using two quad-core CPUs, with span 9 projection data) takes approximately 3.5 hours, giving close to two orders of magnitude acceleration. The method is demonstrated on measured HRRT (High Resolution Research Tomograph) PET data for a [18F]flumazenil study and for an [18F]MPPF study. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

To date, the OSL-MLEM method has been evaluated using kinetic models based on two-tissue compartments with an irreversible component. We extend the evaluation of this method for two-tissue compartments with a reversible component, using SRTM-BFM on simulated 3D + time data sets (with use of [11C]raclopride time-activity curves from real data) and on real data sets acquired with the high resolution research tomograph. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing voxel-level binding potential (BPND) estimates with those obtained from conventional post-reconstruction kinetic parameter estimation. For the commonly chosen number of iterations used in practice, our results show that for the 3D + time simulation, the direct method delivers results with lower %RMSE at the normal count level (decreases of 9-10 percentage points, corresponding to a 38-44% reduction), and also at low count levels (decreases of 17-21 percentage points, corresponding to a 26-36% reduction). As for the real 3D data set, the results obtained follow a similar trend, with the direct reconstruction method offering a 21% decrease in %CV compared to the post reconstruction method at low count levels. Thus, based on the results presented herein, using the SRTM-BFM kinetic model in conjunction with the OSL-MLEM direct 4D PET MLEM reconstruction method offers an improvement in performance when compared to conventional post reconstruction methods.},

abstract = {Objective: Estimation of nonlinear micro-parameters is a computationally demanding and fairly challenging process, since it involves the use of rather slow iterative nonlinear fitting algorithms and it often results in very noisy voxel-wise parametric maps. Direct reconstruction algorithms can provide parametric maps with reduced variance, but usually the overall reconstruction is impractically time consuming with common nonlinear fitting algorithms.
Methods: In this work we employed a recently proposed direct parametric image reconstruction algorithm to estimate the parametric maps of all micro-parameters of a two-tissue compartment model, used to describe the kinetics of [(Formula presented.)F]FDG. The algorithm decouples the tomographic and the kinetic modelling problems, allowing the use of previously developed post-reconstruction methods, such as the generalised linear least squares (GLLS) algorithm.
Results: Results on both clinical and simulated data showed that the proposed direct reconstruction method provides considerable quantitative and qualitative improvements for all micro-parameters compared to the conventional post-reconstruction fitting method. Additionally, region-wise comparison of all parametric maps against the well-established filtered back projection followed by post-reconstruction non-linear fitting, as well as the direct Patlak method, showed substantial quantitative agreement in all regions.
Conclusions: The proposed direct parametric reconstruction algorithm is a promising approach towards the estimation of all individual microparameters of any compartment model. In addition, due to the linearised nature of the GLLS algorithm, the fitting step can be very efficiently implemented and, therefore, it does not considerably affect the overall reconstruction time.},

Direct parametric estimation using 4D image reconstruction can potentially provide parametric maps of reduced bias and variance but little or no evaluation has been done in the body. Previous studies have demonstrated that body [18F]FDG PET/CT imaging can benefit from these methods but analysis was restricted to macroparameters of interest.

By invoking convexity arguments, one can construct a variety of other optimization transfer algorithms that do not involve missing data. These algorithms all rely on a majorizing or minorizing function that serves as a surrogate for the objective function. Optimizing the surrogate function drives the objective function in the correct direction. This article illustrates this general principle by a number of specific examples drawn from the statistical literature. Because optimization transfer algorithms often exhibit the slow convergence of EM algorithms, two methods of accelerating optimization transfer are discussed and evaluated in the context of specific problems.},

@article{Polycarpou2011,
abstract = {Objective: In 3D PET, scatter of the gamma photons is one of the most significant physical factors which degrades not only image quality but also quantification. The currently most used scatter estimation method is the analytic single scatter simulation (SSS) which usually accommodates for multiple scattering by scaling the single scatter estimation. However, it has not been clear yet how accurate this approximation is for cases where multiple scatter is significant, raising the question: "How important is correction for multiple scattered photons, and how accurately do we need to simulate all scattered events by appropriate scaling?" This study answers these questions and evaluates the accuracy of SSS implementation in the open-source library STIR. Methods: Different scatter orders approximations are evaluated including different levels of scattering and different scaling approaches using Monte Carlo (i.e. SimSET) data. SimSET simulations of a large anthropomorphic phantom were reconstructed with iterative reconstruction algorithms. Images reconstructed with 3D filtered back-projection reprojection algorithm have been compared quantitatively in order to clarify the errors due to different scatter order approximations. Results: Quantification in regions has improved by scatter correction. For example, in the heart the ideal value was 3, whereas before scatter correction the standard uptake value (SUV) was 4.0, after single scatter correction was 3.3 and after single and double scatter correction was 3.0. After correction by scaling single scatter with tail-fit, the SUV was 3.1, whereas with total-fit it was 3.0. Similarly, for the SSS correction methodology implemented in STIR using tail-fit the heart SUV was 3.1 whereas using total-fit it was 3.0. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that correction for double scatter improves image contrast and therefore it is required for the accurate estimation of activity distribution in PET imaging. However, it has been also shown that scaling the single scatter distribution is a reasonable approximation to compensate for total scatter. Finally, scatter correction with STIR has shown excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.},

Numerous efforts have been devoted to the development of PET image reconstruction methods over the last four decades, encompassing analytic and iterative reconstruction methods. This article provides an overview of the commonly used methods. Current challenges in PET image reconstruction include more accurate quantitation, TOF imaging, system modeling, motion correction and dynamic reconstruction.

abstract = {True continuous axial bed motion has been implemented on a high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) scanner for use in both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) acquisition modes. This has been accomplished by modifications in the bed motion controller firmware and by acquiring data in list mode. The new bed controller firmware was shown to provide an accurate and constant bed speed down to 0.25 mm/s with a moderate patient weight load. The constant bed motion eliminates previously reported dead-time due to bed positioning when using small discrete bed steps. The continuous bed motion was tested on uniform phantoms, in 2-D and 3-D. As a result of the continuous axial motion, a uniform axial sensitivity is achieved. This was also reflected in the reconstructed images, which showed an improvement in axial image uniformity (1.4% for continuous sampling, 5.0% for discrete) as well as an improvement in %SD uniformity in comparison to conventional step-and-shoot acquisitions. The use of the continuous axial motion also provide slight improvements in 2-D emission and transmission scanning, resulting in an overall improved image quality in whole-body PET.},

	abstract = {{\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.Whole-body (WB) dynamic PET has recently demonstrated its potential in translating the quantitative benefits of parametric imaging to the clinic. Post-reconstruction standard Patlak (sPatlak) WB graphical analysis utilizes multi-bed multi-pass PET acquisition to produce quantitative WB images of the tracer influx rate K i as a complimentary metric to the semi-quantitative standardized uptake value (SUV). The resulting K i images may suffer from high noise due to the need for short acquisition frames. Meanwhile, a generalized Patlak (gPatlak) WB post-reconstruction method had been suggested to limit K i bias of sPatlak analysis at regions with non-negligible 18F-FDG uptake reversibility; however, gPatlak analysis is non-linear and thus can further amplify noise. In the present study, we implemented, within the open-source software for tomographic image reconstruction platform, a clinically adoptable 4D WB reconstruction framework enabling efficient estimation of sPatlak and gPatlak images directly from dynamic multi-bed PET raw data with substantial noise reduction. Furthermore, we employed the optimization transfer methodology to accelerate 4D expectation-maximization (EM) convergence by nesting the fast image-based estimation of Patlak parameters within each iteration cycle of the slower projection-based estimation of dynamic PET images. The novel gPatlak 4D method was initialized from an optimized set of sPatlak ML-EM iterations to facilitate EM convergence. Initially, realistic simulations were conducted utilizing published 18F-FDG kinetic parameters coupled with the XCAT phantom. Quantitative analyses illustrated enhanced K i target-to-background ratio (TBR) and especially contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) performance for the 4D versus the indirect methods and static SUV. Furthermore, considerable convergence acceleration was observed for the nested algorithms involving 10-20 sub-iterations. Moreover, systematic reduction in K i {\{}{\%}{\}} bias and improved TBR were observed for gPatlak versus sPatlak. Finally, validation on clinical WB dynamic data demonstrated the clinical feasibility and superior K i CNR performance for the proposed 4D framework compared to indirect Patlak and SUV imaging.},

abstract = {Continuous bed motion (CBM) has been recently introduced in the clinic as an alternative PET acquisition mode with respect to the traditional time-discretized step-and-shoot (SS) multi-bed acquisitions. In CBM mode, each slice can be considered as a different bed, since it is scanned over a different acquisition window. By reducing scan time discretization from a whole bed down to a single slice, the CBM acquisition offers additional degrees of freedom when designing acquisition protocols and thus larger margins for their optimization. Therefore, CBM mode could be particularly important for protocols of higher complexity, such as whole-body (WB) dynamic PET acquisitions. However, only a few studies have quantitatively validated the 2 modes on clinical data. In this work, we evaluate CBM vs. SS quantitative performance on a set of clinical data acquired over a 0-60min period using a WB dynamic PET acquisition protocol with a Biograph mCT TOF scanner. The TOF resolution (580ps) of the scanner allowed selecting faster CBM speeds (4.2mm/sec) and equivalent SS frames (30sec/bed), eventually permitting acquisition of 12 WB total passes of which half were performed in CBM mode and half in SS mode. The two modes were alternated between successive passes to allow a balanced interleaving of post-injection time between them to ensure an objective comparison. The evaluation of the 2 modes in terms of target-to-background (TBR) contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) has been conducted for various noise levels by gradually adding all respective passes from each mode as well as in the parametric images after applying post-reconstruction WB Patlak analysis. Our results indicate a bias of 10\% between the 2 modes for the low count frames, reducing to <3\% as we gradually add all respective frames. In addition, a small bias of <10\% was observed in Patlak images at overlapped slices between beds, which is attributed to the non-uniformity of the axial sensitivity profile of SS mode.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Continuous bed motion has recently been introduced for whole-body PET/CT, and represents a paradigm shift towards individualized and flexible acquisition without the limitations of bed position-based planning. Increased patient comfort due to lack of abrupt table position changes may be another albeit still unproven advantage. For robust clinical implementation, image quality and quantitative accuracy should at least be equal to the prior standard of bed position-based step-and-shoot imaging. METHODS: The study included 68 consecutive patients referred for whole-body PET/CT for various malignancies. The patients underwent traditional step-and-shoot and novel continuous bed motion acquisition in the same session in a randomized crossover design. The patients and two independent observers were blinded to the sequence of scan techniques. Patient comfort/satisfaction was examined using a standardized questionnaire. SUVs were compared for reference tissue (liver, muscle) and tumour lesions. PET image quality and misalignment with CT images were evaluated on a scale of 1 - 4. RESULTS: Patients preferred continuous bed motion over step-and-shoot (P = 0.0001). It was considered to be more relaxing (38 % vs. 8 %), quieter (34 % vs. 8 %), and more fluid (64 % vs. 8 %). Image quality, SUV and CT misalignment did not differ between the techniques. Continuous bed motion resulted in better end-plane image quality (P < 0.0001). Regardless of the technique, second examinations had significantly higher tumour lesion SUVmax values (P = 0.0002), and a higher CT misalignment score (P = 0.0017). CONCLUSION: Oncological PET/CT with continuous bed motion enhances patient comfort and is associated with image quality at least comparable to that with traditional bed position-based step-and-shoot acquisition.qq.},

abstract = {The continuous motion of the patient bed during the acquisition of PET data represents an alternative to the standard step and shoot protocol where a sequence of discrete, overlapping steps are performed. This PET acquisition mode, similar to the whole body CT scan in which the patient bed moves continuously through the scanner has significant advantages, including uniform axial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), elimination of resolution artifacts by sampling continuously in the axial direction and a reduction in noise from detector normalization. We have implemented and evaluated continuous bed motion acquisition on the combined PET/CT scanner (CPS Innovations, Knoxville, TN). Methods: Emission data were acquired in list mode format with the bed moving at a constant velocity. The position of the bed was recorded in a separate file together with the current event count. The list mode data were then rebinned into sinograms and reconstructed using the same routines applied to reconstruct the standard images. Each sinogram corresponded to an axial plane thickness of 2.4 mm. Phantom data were acquired with both the standard discrete, overlapping steps and with continuous movement of the bed. Data were collected for a whole body phantom containing lesions carefully positioned in the overlap region between two bed positions to specifically emphasize the effect of the improved SNR. Results: The continuous movement of the patient bed resulted in a uniform axial SNR, improving lesion detectability in the bed overlap region. The continuous axial sampling allowed the 10mm lesion in the whole body phantom to have 45% improvement in contrast compared to the step and shoot acquisition. Patient studies demonstrated improved detectability due to finer axial sampling and uniform SNR.},

abstract = {In whole body 3D PET, acquiring at distinct bed positions results in an axially varying sensitivity profile due to the cylindrical geometry and axial sampling pattern of the tomograph. Overlapping the end slices of bed positions can minimize the axial nonuniformity of the noise. We present an algorithm for the weighted summation of overlapped images, where the summation is performed after tomographic reconstruction. The weights are chosen to minimize the variance of the summed image, and are based on the noise equivalent counts in the images and the slice-to-slice coefficients of variation of a uniform cylinder. The optimal overlap is obtained and is 3-5 slices (9-15% system axial field of view) for ramp filters at Nyquist on the GE Advance tomograph in 3D mode. This overlap is smaller than the axial sensitivity profile suggests, due to the smoothing of the end slices in the 3D reprojection algorithm. The optimal overlap is independent of axial filter (due to all slices being smoothed equally); however, the optimal overlap increases as transverse smoothing is increased, because the smoothed noise profile is more consistent with what the axial sensitivity profile suggests. As compared to continuous bed motion, overlapping using weighted image summation requires no specialized acquisition software or reconstruction corrections.},

abstract = {In whole body PET studies, acquisitions are typically overlapped axially to improve the statistics of the slices at the edge of the field of view. This is particularly important in 3D acquisitions where the slice sensitivity profile varies more than in 2D acquisitions. 3D PET data in the overlapped region may be combined after reconstruction, by a weighted average of the corresponding images from the two frames, or the data may be combined after Fourier Rebinning is used to convert it to a stack of 2D transaxial sinograms. Direct combination of the 3D data on a frame by frame basis is difficult because many lines of response through the overlapped region also pass through the non-overlapped regions of image space. This paper describes a memory efficient method for combining overlapped 3D projection plane data in the loop of a fully 3D OSEM algorithm. In this method, a subset of 3D projection plane data is read from each frame and used to update the appropriate region of the ratio and correction images required in the iterative algorithm. The full 3D ratio and correction image volumes are then built for all frames for each subset. With each subset, the ratio and correction image volumes are used to create a new image estimate. This algorithm is compared to post reconstruction overlap correction using 3D OSEM on separate frames. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

In this paper, we describe the principles behind CBM mode planning and its influence on image reconstruction. The data correction method underwent the most changes compared to the commonly used step and shoot (S\&S) mode. The CBM normalization array accommodates for activity decay, dead time correction, and the fact that various detector pairs acquire the same data for different durations. The normalization array is computed by simulating the movement of an object through the scanner, assisted by the monitoring of basic scanner acquisition parameters such as the singles rate. The sensitivity, which is the number of counts acquired per image plane, is an intrinsic part of normalization computing. Basic equations to estimate acquisition time at matched sensitivity between single speed CBM and S\&S mode are presented. The CBM feature was implemented on a Siemens clinical scanner and initial studies of phantoms and patients are presented. The equivalence of single speed CBM and S\&S image quality is demonstrated.},

abstract = {PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article, we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET.},

abstract = {Static whole-body PET/CT, employing the standardized uptake value (SUV), is considered the standard clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment response monitoring for a wide range of oncologic malignancies. Alternative PET protocols involving dynamic acquisition of temporal images have been implemented in the research setting, allowing quantification of tracer dynamics, an important capability for tumor characterization and treatment response monitoring. Nonetheless, dynamic protocols have been confined to single-bed-coverage limiting the axial field-of-view to ∼15–20 cm, and have not been translated to the routine clinical context of whole-body PET imaging for the inspection of disseminated disease. Here, we pursue a transition to dynamic whole-body PET parametric imaging, by presenting, within a unified framework, clinically feasible multi-bed dynamic PET acquisition protocols and parametric imaging methods. We investigate solutions to address the challenges of: (i) long acquisitions, (ii) small number of dynamic frames per bed, and (iii) non-invasive quantification of kinetics in the plasma. In the present study, a novel dynamic (4D) whole-body PET acquisition protocol of ∼45 min total length is presented, composed of (i) an initial 6 min dynamic PET scan (24 frames) over the heart, followed by (ii) a sequence of multi-pass multi-bed PET scans (six passes × seven bed positions, each scanned for 45 s). Standard Patlak linear graphical analysis modeling was employed, coupled with image-derived plasma input function measurements. Ordinary least squares Patlak estimation was used as the baseline regression method to quantify the physiological parameters of tracer uptake rate K i and total blood distribution volume V on an individual voxel basis. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies, using a wide set of published kinetic FDG parameters and GATE and XCAT platforms, were conducted to optimize the acquisition protocol from a range of ten different clinically acceptable sampling schedules examined. The framework was also applied to six FDG PET patient studies, demonstrating clinical feasibility. Both simulated and clinical results indicated enhanced contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) for K i images in tumor regions with notable background FDG concentration, such as the liver, where SUV performed relatively poorly. Overall, the proposed framework enables enhanced quantification of physiological parameters across the whole body. In addition, the total acquisition length can be reduced from 45 to ∼35 min and still achieve improved or equivalent CNR compared to SUV, provided the true K i contrast is sufficiently high. In the follow-up companion paper, a set of advanced linear regression schemes is presented to particularly address the presence of noise, and attempt to achieve a better trade-off between the mean-squared error and the CNR metrics, resulting in enhanced task-based imaging.

abstract = {Multi-Bed FDG PET/CT as applied to oncologic imaging is currently widely
and routinely used for assessment of localized and metastatic disease
involvement. In the past, based on conventional (single-bed) dynamic PET
imaging, standard tracer kinetic modeling techniques have been developed
to estimate the FDG uptake rate K-i. However, routine clinical multi-bed
FDG PET imaging commonly involves a single time frame per bed, i.e.
static imaging, and the standardized uptake value (SUV), a surrogate of
metabolic activity, is employed to estimate the uptake rate K-i. The
accuracy depends on two conditions:(i) in the voxel or region of
interest, contribution of non-phosphorylated FDG is negligible relative
to phosphorylated FDG, and (ii) time integral of plasma FDG
concentration is proportional to injected dose divided by lean body
mass, which can fail in clinical FDG PET imaging and pose problems in
differentiating malignant from benign tumors. The objective of the
proposed work is to facilitate, for the fist time, a transition from
static to dynamic multi-bed FDG PET/CT imaging in clinically feasible
times where, given the challenge of sparse temporal sampling at each
bed, novel dynamic acquisition schemes should be employed to yield
quantitative whole-body imaging of FDG uptake. Thus, a set of novel
dynamic multi-bed PET image acquisition schemes have been modeled, using
Monte Carlo simulations, to quantitatively evaluate the clinical
feasibility of the method and optimize the number of passes per bed and
the total study duration. It has been determined that a data acquisition
scheme consisting of 6 whole-body passes and constant time frames of
45sec produces parametric images with the optimal noise vs. bias
performance. Finally, clinical whole-body patient data have been
acquired dynamically and results demonstrate the potential of the
proposed method in enhancing treatment response monitoring capabilities
of clinical PET studies.},

	abstract = {97Introduction: 18F-FDG PET/CT is a cornerstone in the diagnostic of malignant and non-malignant diseases, with imaging guidelines endorsing static PET images at a single time-point, usually 60 minutes after tracer administration. The method is well-proven and robust, but hampered by the inherent omission of tracer kinetics from injection to acquisition. Recently introduced methodology allows for whole-body dynamic PET/CT scans using conventional PET cameras. The dynamic whole-body data can be used to calculate parametric images of the metabolic rate of glucose using Patlak linearization1, thus utilizing the entire information contained in the blood input function and tissue time-activity curves. It was our goal to retrospectively evaluate whether parametric 18F-FDG PET/CT images have superior lesion target-to-background and if this translates into clinically valuable information. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 48 patients scanned using a multiparametric PET acquisition protocol on a Siemens Biograph Vision 600 PET/CT scanner. Of the 48 patients, 25 had pathological lesions spanning a range of mostly malignant diseases (7 lung cancer, 5 lymphoma, 8 infection \&amp; inflammation, 2 colon cancer, 1 paraganglioma, 1 ovarian cancer and 1 cancer of unknown primary origin.) A 70-min dynamic whole-body PET scan was performed immediately after injection of 18F-FDG, 4 Mbq per kg. The scan included a 6-min dynamic scan of the chest region followed by multiple whole-body passes from 6-70 min. Parametric Patlak images were reconstructed using data from 40-70 min and an image-derived aorta input function [Reconstruction parameters: TrueX+TOF, 8 iterations, 5 subsets, 440 matrix, 2 mm Gaussian filter]. In addition, a standard-of-care static PET image was reconstructed using data from 60-70min [Reconstruction parameters: TrueX+TOF, 4 iterations, 5 subsets, 440 matrix, 2mm Gaussian filter]. Parametric Patlak images of metabolic rate (K) and distribution volume (V) were compared to standard 60-min static SUV images using PMOD 4.0. Target lesions were selected by an experienced nuclear medicine physician and PMOD{\textquoteright}s isocontour tool was used (threshold set to 50\% of max), to obtain the final target region. Background regions were manually drawn in adjoining tissue. Standard SUV values were compared with parameters obtained from dynamic scanning using Patlak reconstructions (K and V). Results: Whole-body parametric Patlak images were of good visual quality and comparable to standard static SUV images. Observed lesion target to background contrast was superior in the parametric K images (p\&lt;0.001), allowing for easier detection of lesions, particularly in organs with high blood pool signal. There was no observable difference between disease groups in background normalized K/SUV ratios. In three patients with focal FDG uptake in the upper arm, Patlak imaging correctly omitted the signal from the K-image avoiding false positives and subsequent biopsies. However, although lesions were easier to detect by Patlak K-images than static images, no additional lesions were detected. Conclusion: Whole-body parametric Patlak-PET/CT imaging provides supplementary information, which may improve the evaluation of PET images. Pointedly, parametric imaging reduced the number of false positive lesions and had superior target-to-background ratios enabling easier image interpretation. Future prospective studies will clarify if parametric 18F-FDG PET/CT may also detect more lesions in diseases characterized by relatively low target-to-background ratios on conventional static PET/CT.},

abstract = {Purpose Hybrid dynamic imaging allows not only the estimation of whole-body (WB) macroparametric maps but also the estimation of microparameters in the initial bed position targeting the blood pool region containing the pathology owing to the limited axial field of view of PET scanners. In this work, we assessed the capability of multipass WB F-FDG PET parametric imaging in terms of lesion detectability through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of simulation and clinical studies. Methods Simulation studies were conducted by generating data incorporating 3 liver and 3 lung lesions produced by 3 noise levels and 20 noise realizations for each noise level to estimate bias and lesion detection features. The total scan time for the clinical studies of 8 patients addressed for lung and liver lesions staging, including dynamic and static WB imaging, lasted 80 minutes. An in-house-developed MATLAB code was utilized to derive the microparametric and macroparametric maps. We compared lesion detectability and different image-derived PET metrics including the SUVs, Patlak-derived influx rate constant (K) and distribution volume (V) and K, k2, k3, blood volume (bv) microparameters, and K estimated using the generalized linear least square approach. Results In total, 104 lesions were detected, among which 47 were located in the targeted blood pool bed position where all quantitative parameters were calculated, thus enabling comparative analysis across all parameters. The evaluation encompassed visual interpretation performed by an expert nuclear medicine specialist and quantitative analysis. High correlation coefficients were observed between SUVmax and Kimax derived from the generalized linear least square approach, as well as K generated by Patlak graphical analysis. Moreover, 3 contrast-enhanced CT-proven malignant lesions located in the liver and a biopsy-proven malignant liver lesion not visible on static SUV images and Patlak maps were clearly pinpointed on K and k2 maps. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that full compartmental modeling for the region containing the pathology has the potential of providing complementary information and, in some cases, more accurate diagnosis than conventional static SUV imaging, favorably comparing to Patlak graphical analysis.},

@article{Merlin2018,
	abstract = {In tomographic medical imaging (PET, SPECT, CT), differences in data acquisition and organization are a major hurdle for the development of tomographic reconstruction software. The implementation of a given reconstruction algorithm is usually limited to a specific set of conditions, depending on the modality, the purpose of the study, the input data, or on the characteristics of the reconstruction algorithm itself. It causes restricted or limited use of algorithms, differences in implementation, code duplication, impractical code development, and difficulties for comparing different methods. This work attempts to address these issues by proposing a unified and generic code framework for formatting, processing and reconstructing acquired multi-modal and multi-dimensional data. The proposed iterative framework processes in the same way elements from list-mode (i.e. events) and histogrammed (i.e. sinogram or other bins) data sets. Each element is processed separately, which opens the way for highly parallel execution. A unique iterative algorithm engine makes use of generic core components corresponding to the main parts of the reconstruction process. Features that are specific to different modalities and algorithms are embedded into specific components inheriting from the generic abstract components. Temporal dimensions are taken into account in the core architecture. The framework is implemented in an open-source C++ parallel platform, called CASToR (customizable and advanced software for tomographic reconstruction). Performance assessments show that the time loss due to genericity remains acceptable, being one order of magnitude slower compared to a manufacturer's software optimized for computational efficiency for a given system geometry. Specific optimizations were made possible by the underlying data set organization and processing and allowed for an average speed-up factor ranging from 1.54 to 3.07 when compared to more conventional implementations. Using parallel programming, an almost linear speed-up increase (factor of 0.85 times number of cores) was obtained in a realistic clinical PET setting. In conclusion, the proposed framework offers a substantial flexibility for the integration of new reconstruction algorithms while maintaining computation efficiency.},

General equations are derived that can be used to analyze tissue uptake data when the blood–plasma concentration of the test substance cannot be easily measured. In addition, general equations are derived for situations when trapping of the test substance is incomplete and for a combination of these two conditions. These derivations are independent of the actual configuration of the compartmental system being analyzed and show what information can be obtained for the period when the reversible compartments are in effective steady state with the blood. This approach is also shown to result in equations with at least one less nonlinear term than those derived from direct compartmental analysis. Specific applications of these equations are illustrated for a compartmental system with one reversible region (with or without reversible binding) and one irreversible region.},

abstract = {A kinetic modeling approach for the quantification of in vivo tracer studies with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) is presented. The approach is based on a general compartmental description of the tracer's fate in vivo and determines a parsimonious model consistent with the measured data. The technique involves the determination of a sparse selection of kinetic basis functions from an overcomplete dictionary using the method of basis pursuit denoising. This enables the characterization of the systems impulse response function from which values of the systems macro parameters can be estimated. These parameter estimates can be obtained from a region of interest analysis or as parametric images from a voxel-based analysis. In addition, model order estimates are returned that correspond to the number of compartments in the estimated compartmental model. Validation studies evaluate the methods performance against two preexisting data led techniques, namely, graphical analysis and spectral analysis. Application of this technique to measured PET data is demonstrated using [C-11]diprenorphine (opiate receptor) and [C-11]WAY-100635 (5-HTIA receptor). Although the method is presented in the context of PET neuroreceptor binding studies, it has general applicability to the quantification of PET/SPECT radiotracer studies in neurology, oncology, and cardiology},

In the recent years SA has been used with a large number of PET tracers in brain and nonbrain applications, demonstrating that it is a very flexible and robust method for PET data analysis. Differently from the most common PET quantification approaches that adopt standard nonlinear estimation of compartmental models or some linear simplifications, SA can be applied without defining any specific model configuration and has demonstrated very good sensitivity to the underlying kinetics. This characteristic makes it useful as an investigative tool especially for the analysis of novel PET tracers.

The role of OATP and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in [11C]GLB whole-body distribution, plasma kinetics, and metabolism was assessed using the OATP inhibitor rifampicin and the dual OATP/P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine. Finally, we used in situ brain perfusion in mice to pinpoint the effect of ABC transporters on GLB transport at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). PET revealed the critical role of OATP on liver [11C]GLB uptake and its subsequent impact on [11C]GLB metabolism and plasma clearance. OATP-mediated uptake also occurred in the myocardium and kidney parenchyma but not the brain. The inhibition of P-gp in addition to OATP did not further influence [ 11C]GLB tissue and plasma kinetics. At the BBB, the inhibition of both P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) was necessary to demonstrate the role of ABC transporters in limiting GLB brain uptake. This study demonstrates that GLB distribution, metabolism, and elimination are greatly dependent on OATP activity, the first step in GLB hepatic clearance. Conversely, P-gp, BCRP, and probably multidrug resistance protein 4 work in synergy to limit GLB brain uptake. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.},

@article{Kudomi2008,
abstract = {Purpose: The liver is perfused through the portal vein and the hepatic artery. When its perfusion is assessed using positron emission tomography (PET) and 15O-labeled water (H215O), calculations require a dual blood input function (DIF), i.e., arterial and portal blood activity curves. The former can be generally obtained invasively, but blood withdrawal from the portal vein is not feasible in humans. The aim of the present study was to develop a new technique to estimate quantitative liver perfusion from H215O PET images with a completely non-invasive approach. Methods: We studied normal pigs (n=14) in which arterial and portal blood tracer concentrations and Doppler ultrasonography flow rates were determined invasively to serve as reference measurements. Our technique consisted of using model DIF to create tissue model function and the latter method to simultaneously fit multiple liver time-activity curves from images. The parameters obtained reproduced the DIF. Simulation studies were performed to examine the magnitude of potential biases in the flow values and to optimize the extraction of multiple tissue curves from the image. Results: The simulation showed that the error associated with assumed parameters was <10\%, and the optimal number of tissue curves was between 10 and 20. The estimated DIFs were well reproduced against the measured ones. In addition, the calculated liver perfusion values were not different between the methods and showed a tight correlation (r=0.90). Conclusion: In conclusion, our results demonstrate that DIF can be estimated directly from tissue curves obtained through H215O PET imaging. This suggests the possibility to enable completely non-invasive technique to assess liver perfusion in patho-physiological studies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Purpose: Quantification of hepatic tracer kinetics by PET requires measurement of tracer input from the hepatic artery (HA) and portal vein (PV). We wished to develop a method for estimating dual tracer input without the necessity to sample PV blood. Methods: Pigs weighing 40 kg were given bolus doses of C15O (CO), 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), [11C]-methylglucose (MG), 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D- galactose (FDGal) or H215O (H2O). Tracer concentration 3-min time courses were measured in the femoral artery and PV by blood sampling. Blood flow was measured in the HA and PV using flow-meters. A model for transfer of tracer through the splanchnic circulation was used to estimate values of a tracer-specific model parameter $\beta$. Tracer-specific mean values of $\beta$ were used to estimate tracer concentration time courses in the PV from the measured arterial concentration. A model-derived dual-input was calculated using the mean HA flow fraction (0.25) and validated by comparison of the use of the measured dual-input and a kinetic model with a fixed "true" K 1true, i.e. clearance of tracer from blood to liver cells. Results: The rank order of the means of $\beta$ was CO<FDG≈MG<FDGal<H2O, reflecting their different splanchnic mean transit times. Estimated K 1est was not significantly different from "true" K 1true. Conclusion: The hepatic dual tracer input, which is of great importance for the assessment of processes such as transfer across the plasma-hepatocyte membrane or hepatic blood perfusion, can be well approximated in pigs without the necessity to sample PV blood and measure hepatic blood flow; only arterial blood sampling is needed. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with radiolabeled drugs holds great promise to assess the influence of membrane transporters on hepatobiliary clearance of drugs. To exploit the full potential of PET, quantitative pharmacokinetic models are required. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of different compartment models to describe the hepatic disposition of [ 11 C]erlotinib as a small-molecule model drug which undergoes transporter-mediated hepatobiliary excretion. We analyzed two different, previously published data sets in healthy volunteers, in which a baseline [ 11 C]erlotinib PET scan was followed by a second PET scan either after oral intake of unlabeled erlotinib (300 mg) or after intravenous infusion of the prototypical organic anion-transporting polypeptide inhibitor rifampicin (600 mg). We assessed a three-compartment (3C) and a four-compartment (4C) model, in which either a sampled arterial blood input function or a mathematically derived dual input function (DIF), which takes the contribution of the portal vein to the liver blood supply into account, was used. Both models provided acceptable fits of the observed PET data in the liver and extrahepatic bile duct and gall bladder. Changes in model outcome parameters between scans were consistent with the involvement of basolateral hepatocyte uptake and canalicular efflux transporters in the hepatobiliary clearance of [ 11 C]erlotinib. Our results demonstrated that inclusion of a DIF did not lead to substantial improvements in model fits. The models developed in this work represent a step forward in applying PET as a tool to assess the impact of hepatic transporters on drug disposition and their involvement in drug-drug interactions.},

abstract = {The hallmark of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is hepatocellular inflammation and injury in the setting of hepatic steatosis. Recent work has indicated that dynamic 18F-FDG PET with kinetic modeling has the potential to assess hepatic inflammation noninvasively, while static FDG-PET is less promising. Because the liver has dual blood supplies, kinetic modeling of dynamic liver PET data is challenging in human studies. This paper aims to identify the optimal dual-input kinetic modeling approach for dynamic FDG-PET of human liver inflammation. Fourteen patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were included. Each patient underwent 1 h dynamic FDG-PET/CT scan and had liver biopsy within six weeks. Three models were tested for kinetic analysis: the traditional two-tissue compartmental model with an image-derived single-blood input function (SBIF), a model with population-based dual-blood input function (DBIF), and a new model with optimization-derived DBIF through a joint estimation framework. The three models were compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC), F test and histopathologic inflammation score. Results showed that the optimization-derived DBIF model improved liver time activity curve fitting and achieved lower AIC values and higher F values than the SBIF and population-based DBIF models in all patients. The optimization-derived model significantly increased FDG K1 estimates by 101\% and 27\% as compared with traditional SBIF and population-based DBIF. K1 by the optimization-derived model was significantly associated with histopathologic grades of liver inflammation while the other two models did not provide a statistical significance. In conclusion, modeling of DBIF is critical for dynamic liver FDG-PET kinetic analysis in human studies. The optimization-derived DBIF model is more appropriate than SBIF and population-based DBIF for dynamic FDG-PET of liver inflammation.},

	abstract = {Parametric imaging using the Patlak graphical method has been widely used to analyze dynamic PET data. Conventionally a Patlak parametric image is generated by reconstructing a sequence of dynamic images first and then performing Patlak graphical analysis on the time-activity curves pixel-by-pixel. However, because it is rather difficult to model the noise distribution in reconstructed images, the spatially variant noise correlation is simply ignored in the Patlak analysis, which leads to sub-optimal results. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for reconstructing Patlak parametric images directly from raw sinogram data by incorporating the Patlak plot model into the image reconstruction procedure. A preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm is used to find the maximum a posteriori solution. The proposed direct method is statistically more efficient than the conventional indirect approach because the Poisson noise distribution in PET data can be accurately modeled in the direct reconstruction. The computation cost of the direct method is similar to reconstruction time of two dynamic frames. Therefore, when more than two dynamic frames are used in the Patlak analysis, the direct method is faster than the conventional indirect approach. We conduct computer simulations to validate the proposed direct method. Comparisons with the conventional indirect approach show that the proposed method results in a more accurate estimate of the parametric image. The proposed method has been applied to dynamic fully 3D PET data from a microPET scanner.},

	abstract = {An overview of the theory of 4D image reconstruction for emission tomography is given along with a review of the current state of the art, covering both positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). By viewing 4D image reconstruction as a matter of either linear or non-linear parameter estimation for a set of spatiotemporal functions chosen to approximately represent the radiotracer distribution, the areas of so-called 'fully 4D' image reconstruction and 'direct kinetic parameter estimation' are unified within a common framework. Many choices of linear and non-linear parameterization of these functions are considered (including the important case where the parameters have direct biological meaning), along with a review of the algorithms which are able to estimate these often non-linear parameters from emission tomography data. The other crucial components to image reconstruction (the objective function, the system model and the raw data format) are also covered, but in less detail due to the relatively straightforward extension from their corresponding components in conventional 3D image reconstruction. The key unifying concept is that maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of either linear or non-linear model parameters can be achieved in image space after carrying out a conventional expectation maximization (EM) update of the dynamic image series, using a Kullback-Leibler distance metric (comparing the modeled image values with the EM image values), to optimize the desired parameters. For MAP, an image-space penalty for regularization purposes is required. The benefits of 4D and direct reconstruction reported in the literature are reviewed, and furthermore demonstrated with simple simulation examples. It is clear that the future of reconstructing dynamic or functional emission tomography images, which often exhibit high levels of spatially correlated noise, should ideally exploit these 4D approaches.},

abstract = {Due to its simplicity, computational efficiency, and reliability, weighted linear regression (WLR) is widely used for generation of parametric imaging in positron emission tomography (PET) studies, but parametric images estimated by WLR usually have high image noise level. To improve the stability and signal-to-noise ratio of the estimated parametric images, we have added ridge regression, a statistical technique that reduces estimation variability at the expense of a small bias. To minimize the bias, spatially smoothed images obtained with WLR are used as a constraint for ridge regression. This new algorithm consists of two steps. First, parametric images are generated by WLR and are spatially smoothed. Ridge regression is then applied using the smoothed parametric images obtained in the first step as the constraint. Since both "generalized" ridge regression and "simple" ridge regression are used in statistical applications, we evaluated specifically in this study the relative advantages of the two when incorporated for generating parametric images from dynamic O-15 water PET studies. Computer simulations of a dynamic PET study with the spatial configuration of Hoffman's brain phantom and a real human PET study were used as the data for the evaluation. Results reveal ridge regressions improve image quality of parametric images for studies with high or middle noise level, as compared to WLR. Use of generalized ridge regression offers little advantage over that of simple ridge regression.},

However, the original algorithm was designed for parameter estimation with non-uniformly sampled instantaneous measurements. When dynamic PET data are sampled with the optimal image sampling schedule (OISS) to reduce memory and storage space, only a few temporal image frames are recorded. As a result, the direct application of GLLS is no longer appropriate. In this paper, we extend the GLLS algorithm to a five parameter model for the study of human brain metabolism, which accounts for the effect of cerebral blood volume (CBV), using OISS sampled data, with as few as five temporal samples.

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) plays an increasingly important role in research and clinical applications, catalysed by remarkable technical advances and a growing appreciation of the need for reliable, sensitive biomarkers of human function in health and disease. Over the last 30 years, a large amount of the physics and engineering effort in PET has been motivated by the dominant clinical application during that period, oncology. This has led to important developments such as PET/CT, whole-body PET, 3D PET, accelerated statistical image reconstruction, and time-of-flight PET. Despite impressive improvements in image quality as a result of these advances, the emphasis on static, semi-quantitative 'hot spot' imaging for oncologic applications has meant that the capability of PET to quantify biologically relevant parameters based on tracer kinetics has not been fully exploited. More recent advances, such as PET/MR and total-body PET, have opened up the ability to address a vast range of new research questions, from which a future expansion of applications and radiotracers appears highly likely. Many of these new applications and tracers will, at least initially, require quantitative analyses that more fully exploit the exquisite sensitivity of PET and the tracer principle on which it is based. It is also expected that they will require more sophisticated quantitative analysis methods than those that are currently available. At the same time, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing data analysis and impacting the relationship between the statistical quality of the acquired data and the information we can extract from the data. In this roadmap, leaders of the key sub-disciplines of the field identify the challenges and opportunities to be addressed over the next ten years that will enable PET to realise its full quantitative potential, initially in research laboratories and, ultimately, in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {PET was developed in the 1970s as an in vivo method to measure regional pathophysiologic processes. In the 1990s the focus moved to the detection of local increases in uptake, first in the brain (activation studies) and later in oncology (finding metastases), with 18F-FDG emerging as a highly sensitive staging technique. This focus on sensitivity has overshadowed the other main characteristic of PET, its quantitative nature. In recent years there has been a shift. PET is now seen as a promising tool for drug development and precision medicine-that is, a method to monitor or even predict response to therapy. Quantification is essential for precision medicine, but many studies today use simplified semiquantitative methods without properly validating them. This review provides several examples illustrating that simplified methods may lead to less accurate or even misleading results. Simplification is important for routine clinical practice, but finding the optimal balance between accuracy and simplicity requires careful studies. It is argued that the use of simplified approaches without proper validation not only may waste time and resources but also may raise ethical questions, especially in drug development studies.},

Although it is generally accepted that the information provided by dPET is superior to that of conventional static PET acquisitions acquired usually 60min post injection of the radiotracer, the duration of dynamic protocols, the limited axial field of view (FOV) of current generation clinical PET systems covering a relatively small axial extent of the human body for a dynamic measurement, and the complexity of data evaluation have hampered its implementation into clinical routine. However, the development of new-generation PET/CT scanners with an extended FOV as well as of more sophisticated evaluation software packages that offer better segmentation algorithms, automatic retrieval of the arterial input function, and automatic calculation of parametric imaging, in combination with dedicated shorter dynamic protocols, will facilitate the wider use of dPET. This is expected to aid in oncological diagnostics and therapy assessment. The aim of this review is to present some general considerations about dPET analysis in oncology by means of kinetic modeling, based on compartmental and noncompartmental approaches, and parametric imaging. Moreover, the current clinical applications and future perspectives of the modality are outlined.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE In this article, we discuss dynamic whole-body (DWB) positron emission tomography (PET) as an imaging tool with significant clinical potential, in relation to conventional standard uptake value (SUV) imaging. BACKGROUND DWB PET involves dynamic data acquisition over an extended axial range, capturing tracer kinetic information that is not available with conventional static acquisition protocols. The method can be performed within reasonable clinical imaging times, and enables generation of multiple types of PET images with complementary information in a single imaging session. Importantly, DWB PET can be used to produce multi-parametric images of (i) Patlak slope (influx rate) and (ii) intercept (referred to sometimes as "distribution volume"), while also providing (iii) a conventional 'SUV-equivalent' image for certain protocols. RESULTS We provide an overview of ongoing efforts (primarily focused on FDG PET) and discuss potential clinically relevant applications. CONCLUSION Overall, the framework of DWB imaging [applicable to both PET/CT(computed tomography) and PET/MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)] generates quantitative measures that may add significant value to conventional SUV image-derived measures, with limited pitfalls as we also discuss in this work.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction have demonstrated that it is possible to achieve markedly improved end-point kinetic parameter maps by incorporating a temporal model of the radiotracer directly into the reconstruction algorithm. In this work we have developed a highly constrained, fully dynamic PET reconstruction algorithm incorporating both spectral analysis temporal basis functions and spatial basis functions derived from the kernel method applied to a co-registered T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image. The dynamic PET image is modelled as a linear combination of spatial and temporal basis functions, and a maximum likelihood estimate for the coefficients can be found using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Following reconstruction, kinetic fitting using any temporal model of interest can be applied. Based on a BrainWeb T1-weighted MR phantom, we performed a realistic dynamic [ 18 F]FDG simulation study with two noise levels, and investigated the quantitative performance of the proposed reconstruction algorithm, comparing it with reconstructions incorporating either spectral analysis temporal basis functions alone or kernel spatial basis functions alone, as well as with conventional frame-independent reconstruction. Compared to the other reconstruction algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieved superior performance, offering a decrease in spatially averaged pixel-level root-mean-square-error on post-reconstruction kinetic parametric maps in the grey/white matter, as well as in the tumours when they were present on the co-registered MR image. When the tumours were not visible in the MR image, reconstruction with the proposed algorithm performed similarly to reconstruction with spectral temporal basis functions and was superior to both conventional frame-independent reconstruction and frame-independent reconstruction with kernel spatial basis functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a joint spectral/kernel model can also be used for effective post-reconstruction denoising, through the use of an EM-like image-space algorithm. Finally, we applied the proposed algorithm to reconstruction of real high-resolution dynamic [ 11 C]SCH23390 data, showing promising results.},

	abstract = {A new dynamic image reconstruction method for PET is proposed. First, a set of exponential temporal basis functions is predefined, covering the entire range of kinetics (from static through to a delta function). Just as in spectral analysis, such a selection is designed to be able to handle all possible tissue responses for multi-compartmental tissue models. Second, an initial estimate of an input function is defined. The time-dependent PET radiotracer concentration is then modeled (through the system matrix in the reconstruction algorithm) as a superposition of the exponential temporal basis functions, convolved with the input function. The reconstruction method uses an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to operate directly on the measured PET data in order to i. estimate the coefficients of the exponential functions, and ii. improve the estimate of the input function. The coefficients and the input function are estimated only as a means of regularizing the model of the time-dependent image: the final reconstruction is used with conventional post-reconstruction kinetic analysis, with a different input function if need be (as the estimated input function may not correspond to the true input function). Results from tests on simulated data reveal a simultaneous benefit of noise reduction and improved kinetic parameter estimates when compared to conventional methodology. The method is also demonstrated on measured HRRT PET data for an FDG study.},

With the recent development of combined PET/MR systems, we can improve the PET image quality by incorporating MR information into image reconstruction. Previously kernel learning has been successfully embedded into static and dynamic PET image reconstruction using either PET temporal or MRI information. Here we combine both PET temporal and MRI information adaptively to improve the quality of direct Patlak reconstruction. We examined different approaches to combine the PET and MRI information in kernel learning to address the issue of potential mismatches between MRI and PET signals. Computer simulations and hybrid real patient data acquired on a simultaneous PET/MR scanner were used to evaluate the proposed methods. Results show that the method that combines PET temporal information and MRI spatial information adaptively based on the structure similarity index (SSIM) has the best performance in terms of noise reduction and resolution improvement.},

	abstract = {Spectral analysis is a general modelling approach that enables calculation of parametric images from reconstructed tracer kinetic data independent of an assumed compartmental structure. We investigated the validity of applying spectral analysis directly to projection data motivated by the advantages that: (i) the number of reconstructions is reduced by an order of magnitude and (ii) iterative reconstruction becomes practical which may improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A dynamic software phantom with typical 2-[11C]thymidine kinetics was used to compare projection-based and image-based methods and to assess bias-variance trade-offs using iterative expectation maximization (EM) reconstruction, We found that the two approaches are not exactly equivalent due to properties of the non-negative least-squares algorithm. However, the differences are small (<5\%) and mainly affect parameters related to early and late time points on the impulse response function (K1 and, to a lesser extent, VD). The optimal number of EM iterations was 15-30 with up to a two-fold improvement in SNR over filtered back projection. We conclude that projection-based spectral analysis with EM reconstruction yields accurate parametric images with high SNR and has potential application to a wide range of positron emission tomography ligands.},

abstract = {The recently developed total-body PET scanner enables high temporal resolution in dynamic imaging. Due to the much improved temporal resolution and large field of view, delay and the dispersion effects in the image-derived input function, which vary for different tissues and organs, may affect accuracy in parametric imaging. In this paper, the delay effect was studied using the early kinetics of an FDG scan, which may be approximated using a 1-tissue compartment model. Dynamic reconstructed frames were acquired using the total-body PET scanner with 1-second frames for the first 30 seconds and 2 seconds for the subsequent 60 seconds. The image-derived input function was acquired from the reconstructed dynamic sequence using volumes of interest in the ascending and descending aorta. Voxel-specific delay times for the plasma input function were also modeled within the 1-tissue compartment model. A total of 4 parametric images were generated. Image-based parametric image generation was achieved with a maximum likelihood estimation method. Parametric images with and without the modeling of delay time in the input function were compared. Additional image denoising techniques including Gaussian denoising and non-local-mean denoising were employed. Quantitative evaluation was achieved by the calculation of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The voxel-specific parameters of the 1-tissue compartment together with the delay time were successfully reconstructed using the proposed method. The estimated delay time showed variations as large as 40 seconds. The non-local-mean filter was shown to be able to reduce the image noise of the generated parametric images. Various image artifacts were observed when no delay time model was included. We have shown that with the use of total-body PET and the increased sensitivity, it is possible to estimate parametric images using the very early stages of the FDG injection. The combined effects of delay and dispersion will be studied in the future.},

In application where low-dose gated PET is useful, reducing injection dose causes increased noise levels in gated images that could corrupt motion estimation and subsequent corrections, leading to inferior image quality.

Specifically, we proposed a Temporal Siamese Pyramid Network (TSP-Net) with basic units made up of 1.)

The denoising network is unified with our motion estimation network to simultaneously correct the motion and predict a motion-compensated denoised PET reconstruction.

Comparative studies with previous methods also show that our MDPET is able to generate superior motion estimation and denoising performance.

abstract = {Objective: Positron emission tomography (PET) provides an accurate measurement of radiotracer concentration in vivo, but performance can be limited by subject motion which degrades spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy. This effect may become a limiting factor for PET studies in the body as PET scanner technology improves. In this work, we propose a new approach to address this problem by employing motion information from images measured simultaneously using a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. Methods: The approach is demonstrated using an MR-compatible PET scanner and PET-MR acquisition with a purpose-designed phantom capable of non-rigid deformations. Measured, simultaneously acquired MR data were used to correct for motion in PET, and results were compared with those obtained using motion information from PET images alone. Results: Motion artefacts were significantly reduced and the PET image quality and quantification was significantly improved by the use of MR motion fields, whilst the use of PET-only motion information was less successful. Conclusions: Combined PET-MR acquisitions potentially allow PET motion compensation in whole-body acquisitions without prolonging PET acquisition time or increasing radiation dose. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study to demonstrate that simultaneously acquired MR data can be used to estimate and correct for the effects of non-rigid motion in PET. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.},

abstract = {Gating is commonly used in PET imaging to reduce respiratory motion blurring and facilitate more sophisticated motion correction methods. In the applications of low dose PET, however, reducing injection dose causes increased noise and reduces signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), subsequently corrupting the motion estimation/correction steps, causing inferior image quality. To tackle these issues, we first propose a Siamese adversarial network (SAN) that can efficiently recover high dose gated image volume from low dose gated image volume. To ensure the appearance consistency between the recovered gated volumes, we then utilize a pre-trained motion estimation network incorporated into SAN that enables the constraint of gate-to-gate (G2G) consistency. With high-quality recovered gated volumes, gate-to-gate motion vectors can be simultaneously outputted from the motion estimation network. Comprehensive evaluations on a low dose gated PET dataset of 29 subjects demonstrate that our method can effectively recover the low dose gated PET volumes, with an average PSNR of 37.16 and SSIM of 0.97, and simultaneously generate robust motion estimation that could benefit subsequent motion corrections.},

However it suffers from subject motion which is inevitable during the typical acquisition time of 1–2 hours. In this work we propose a framework to jointly estimate subject head motion and reconstruct the motion-corrected parametric images directly from raw PET data, so that the effects of distorted tissue-to-voxel mapping due to subject motion can be reduced in reconstructing the parametric images with motion-compensated attenu-ation correction and spatially aligned temporal PET data. The proposed approach is formulated within the maximum likelihood framework, and efficient solutions are derived for estimating subject motion and kinetic parameters from raw PET photon count data. Results from evaluations on simulated [ 11 C]raclopride data using the Zubal brain phan-tom and real clinical [ 18 F]florbetapir data of a patient with Alzheimer's disease show that the proposed joint direct parametric reconstruction motion correction approach can improve the accuracy of quantifying dynamic PET data with large subject motion.},

abstract = {Head motion during brain PET imaging is not uncommon and can negatively affect image quality. Motion correction techniques typically either use hardware to prospectively measure head motion, or they divide the acquisition into short fixed-frames and then align and combine these to produce a motion free image. The aim of this work was to retrospectively detect when motion occurred in PET data without the use of motion detection hardware, and then align the frames defined by these motion occurrences. We describe two methods that use either principal component analysis or the motion induced spatial displacements over time to detect motion in raw time-of-flight PET data. The points in time of motion then define the temporal boundaries of frames which are reconstructed without attenuation correction, aligned and combined. Phantom and [18F]-Fallypride patient acquisitions were used to validate and evaluate these approaches, which were compared with motion estimation using 60 s fixed-frames. Both methods identified all motion occurrences in phantom data, and unlike the fixed-frame approach did not exhibit intra-frame motion. With patient acquisitions, images corrected with the motion detection methods increased the average image sharpness by the same amount as the fixed-frame approach, but reduced the number of reconstructions and registrations by a factor of 3.4 on average. Detecting head motion in raw PET data alone is possible, allowing retrospective motion estimation of any listmode brain PET acquisition without additional hardware, subsequently decreasing data processing and potentially reducing intra-frame motion.},

	abstract = {1551Introduction: Commercially available PET/CT scanners with long axial field of views (LAFOV) offer very good time-of-flight (TOF) resolution about 215 ps. The raw data sizes increase significantly with such scanners, nevertheless, currently achievable TOF resolution allows substantial data compression, the histo-projections data format in Vision PET/CT scanners. Furthermore, patient motion during the scan is unavoidable; however, non-rigid motion estimation and correction can be performed directly in the quasi-image space of histo-projections by exploiting the spatial information of the TOF signal properties. Specifically, an approximation of rigid motion on a scale of the TOF resolution is used. In addition, data driven motion detection is particularly attractive in LAFOV scanners since the entire patient is visible at once. Once motion correction is performed in histo-projections, a regular reconstruction can be performed on a single data set, in contrast to motion framed approaches. The current work focusses on respiratory Motion Correction (MC) using a Biograph Vision Quadra scanner that offers a 106cm axial FOV. Methods: In this proof of concept study, initial patient data acquired on Biograph Vision Quadra was analyzed. A portion of the histo-image (that is combination of all view dependent histo-projections), significant in axial extend and covering the lung and abdomen regions, was used to obtain a gating signal in form of value of axial component of histo-image center of mass. A clear respiratory signal was derived in patients receiving FDG and PSMA. A patient with colon cancer and significant liver motion was chosen for further analysis (258 MBq of FDG with a 120 min uptake, single bed (106cm) acquisition of 4 mins duration) The reconstruction employed a maximum ring difference limited to 18{\textdegree} acceptance angle, the current clinical reconstruction protocol. However, the histo-image formation used the maximum ring difference, corresponding to all lines-of-response or 52{\textdegree}. The histo-image data were gated, resulting in four histo-image frames. Motion vector field was estimated from these gated histo-images by the Lucas-Kanade optical flow method. Results: Improvement by removing motion blur and maintaining similar noise level was apparent in comparison between image space MC reconstruction and static (no MC) reconstruction. MC reconstruction background cardiac region was 14\% noisier; the SUV of a liver lesion was about 80\% higher in value compared with the SUV value using a static reconstruction. Comparing with single gate of a {\textquotedblleft}motion frozen{\textquotedblright} reconstruction, MC reconstruction displayed less noise while maintaining contrast recovery: gated data reconstruction cardiac region was noisier about 50\% and liver lesion was higher by 15\%. Conclusions: The standard optical flow motion estimation algorithm is capable of distinguishing respiratory motion in relevant body regions, such motion in the liver and identifying the absence of motion in the rest of body, such as head. The presented methodology performs non-rigid motion correction in sufficiently high TOF resolution quasi-image space.

@article{Germino2016,
abstract = {Direct reconstruction algorithms for PET are capable of producing lower variance parametric images than those from the traditional frame-based approach. However, if the selected kinetic model is not appropriate for all voxels in the field-of-view, structured residuals from poor model fits can propagate bias into neighbouring regions where the model is accurate. We previously proposed a direct reconstruction algorithm for cardiac PET that fits the kinetic model only at voxels in a pre-specified mask, and uses cubic B-splines elsewhere. Here we present an automated approach to generate this mask, based on k-means clustering of the residuals from a frame-based fit. In this application, the cluster-based mask allowed the kinetic model to be fit to many more voxels than those defined by a manually drawn myocardium region. However, the resulting parameter estimates had comparable agreement with frame-based estimates as those generated using the more restrictive mask. The hybrid method with either the manually defined or cluster-based mask was in better agreement with the frame-based method than a direct reconstruction using the kinetic model in all voxels, suggesting that the hybrid method with a cluster-based mask can reduce bias from error propagation of non-model fits.},

abstract = {When a function of two variables (a point function in the plane) is integrated subject to suitable regularity conditions along an arbitrary straight line, a line function is obtained in the integral values. The inversion of such a linear functional transformation is obtained, giving answers to the following questions: can every line function satisfying suitable regularity conditions be regarded as constructed in this way? If so, is the point function uniquely known from the line function, and how can the point function be calculated? A solution is also presented for the dual problem of calculating a line function from its point mean values. Certain generalizations are discussed that were prompted by consideration of non-Euclidean manifolds as well as higher-dimensional spaces.

@article{Stute2013,
abstract = {Iterative reconstructions in positron emission tomography (PET) need a model relating the recorded data to the object/patient being imaged, called the system matrix (SM). The more realistic this model, the better the spatial resolution in the reconstructed images. However, a serious concern when using a SM that accurately models the resolution properties of the PET system is the undesirable edge artefact, visible through oscillations near sharp discontinuities in the reconstructed images. This artefact is a natural consequence of solving an ill-conditioned inverse problem, where the recorded data are band-limited. In this paper, we focus on practical aspects when considering image-based point-spread function (PSF) reconstructions. To remove the edge artefact, we propose to use a particular case of the method of sieves (Grenander 1981 Abstract Inference New York: Wiley), which simply consists in performing a standard PSF reconstruction, followed by a post-smoothing using the PSF as the convolution kernel. Using analytical simulations, we investigate the impact of different reconstruction and PSF modelling parameters on the edge artefact and its suppression, in the case of noise-free data and an exactly known PSF. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we assess the proposed method of sieves with respect to the choice of the geometric projector and the PSF model used in the reconstruction. When the PSF model is accurately known, we show that the proposed method of sieves succeeds in completely suppressing the edge artefact, though after a number of iterations higher than typically used in practice. When applying the method to realistic data (i.e. unknown true SM and noisy data), we show that the choice of the geometric projector and the PSF model does not impact the results in terms of noise and contrast recovery, as long as the PSF has a width close to the true PSF one. Equivalent results were obtained using either blobs or voxels in the same conditions (i.e. the blob's density function being the same as the voxel-based PSF). From a practical point-of-view, the method can be used to perform fast reconstructions based on very simple models (compared to sinogram-based PSF modelling), producing artefact-free images with a better compromise between noise and spatial resolution than images reconstructed without or with under-estimated PSF. Besides, the method inherently limits the spatial resolution in the reconstructed images to the intrinsic one of the PET system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

@article{Gallezot2018,
abstract = {Direct Expectation-Maximization (EM) reconstruction of parametric images from PET data has been proposed, to take advantage of the known Poisson character of raw PET data. However, direct reconstruction algorithms are then dependent on the properties of the kinetic model and of the radiotracer used. Moreover, the first direct EM reconstruction algorithm proposed, the Parametric Iterative Reconstruction (PIR) algorithm, based on the Patlak plot, converges slowly when applied to [^{18\mathrm{F}}]FDG data. Thus, alternative algorithms have been proposed to accelerate convergence. In this study, we propose additional strategies to improve the PIR algorithm. One strategy is to use a line search procedure to increase the size of steps taken at each iteration (PIR-LS). Another group of strategies is to apply physiological constraints (PIR-PC) on the intercept parameter of the Patlak plot, since this parameter has a small dynamic range and is more stable across subjects and across physiological and disease states. The third strategy is to apply a linear transform to the independent variables of the Patlak model (PIR-LTIV) to obtain new independent variables more favorable for convergence. PIR-LS, PIR-PC and PIR-LTIV were first compared to PIR and the Nested EM algorithm on simulated 2D data. Results showed that all new methods could increase the convergence speed of PIR, with PIR-LTIV having the fastest convergence among the new methods, and similar to that of the Nested EM algorithm. Then, PIR and PIR-LS were compared using a simulated dynamic brain dataset, PIR andPIR-PC were compared on a real lung tumor data set, and PIR-LTIV was tested on simulated brain data, real brain data, and the real lung tumor dataset. These data confirmed that all new methodscould increase PIR convergence, with PIR-LTIV being the most promising since convergence speed was visually similar to that of indirect reconstructions, with lower image noise.},
