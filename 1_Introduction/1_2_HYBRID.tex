\Gls{hybrid} is an industrial academic \gls{itn}, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\l{}odowska-Curie grant agreement No 764458.
The aim of the \gls{hybrid} group is to advance and fully exploit the potential of integrated, dual-modality and multi-parametric imaging offered by multi-modality hybrid imaging. Quantitative and parametric imaging is at the centre of focus of the group. 

The main challenges that were addressed by the group define the three main work packages of the programme:
\begin{itemize}
    \item WP2: Data collection \\
    The aim of the data collection group is to address challenges of multi-modality data acquisitions for the reliable formation of parametric and multi-parametric images. 
    \item WB3: Data processing \\
    The aim of the data processing group is to explore and improve on methods of extracting information using multi-parametric imaging and multiple parameters. 
    \item WB4: Clinical translation \\
    The aim of this group is to explore integration techniques of multi-parametric imaging into clinical use-case scenarios. 
\end{itemize}

This PhD project was conducted as part of the data collection group WP2 (WP2.4). The aim of the project was to expand computation and use of fully-quantitative parametric maps in PET to whole-body datasets. Specifically the direction of the project was towards development of clinically viable schemes for parametric whole-body PET/MR imaging for improved characterisation of oncological diseases throughout the body. 

Secondments between the partner organisations were planned within the \gls{hybrid} network. The aim of secondments is for the participating PhD students to learn from practices in other organisation and engage in multi-centre research projects. Two academic and one industrial secondment was planned for each student. 
In this project, secondments were planned with the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), the Medical University of Vienna (MUW) and with General Electric healthcare (GEHC). These were conducted with the following order, with the described motives and outcomes.

\begin{itemize}
    \item UMCH \\
    This secondment was planned in order to gain experience in PET kinetic modelling for research studies and explore uses of analysis methods that can translate in practices to this PhD project. 
    \item MUW \\
    The initial purpose of this secondment was to make use of already developed advanced reconstruction techniques from this project, to a cohort of epilepsy dynamic PET dataset at MUW for generation of parametric images. Due to the current pandemic, the majority of the secondment was conducted remotely. The collaboration project was slightly adapted to be performed by distance and focused more on motion correction aspects for dynamic brain PET. 
    \item GEHC: Milwaukee \\
    The secondment was planned at the main factory facility which hosts the research and development team of GE's PET/MR systems. The purpose of the secondment was to .
    In addition this secondment served as an experience of research and development in an industrial setup.
    \item GEHC: Zürich \\
    The secondment with GE also took part at the University hospital of Zürich, where GE conducts clinical research and development of protocols. 
\end{itemize}

Apart from the secondments, the \gls{hybrid} network conducted many meetings (approximately twice a year) where all the participants would come together and discuss progress. These meetings served substantially in exchange of ideas and guidance on individual research projects as well as in forming of collaborations.
