\chapter{Discussion}
Dynamic reconstruction applied on multi-bed data acquired with a Step and Shoot protocol has been successfully applied on DWB data using generic 


Need for motion estimation 
Need for motion correction in reconstruction (preferable list-mode) to avoid motion contribution to structures and artefacts in dynamic reconstruction.
